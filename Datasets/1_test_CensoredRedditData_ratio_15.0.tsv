TL;DR an expungement will prevent the public or private enterprises from being able to access your conviction data, but the court can still access it if a judge orders it, and there may be instances where you need to deliver a certified copy of the expungement order to certain agencies (it's not like they all share a single database). Take one with you to a recruiting office, for example, and everything should be fine. If you ever get your firearm rights restored and decide to get a concealed carry permit you will also need to attach a copy of the expungement order to your application, although in Utah's case the Bureau which handles background checks for CCW may automatically get copies of court expungement orders (not sure)."

It's literally just a job mill for them, no unlike a lot of call center jobs in the US here. The problem is, they are often taking on work that requires more than ""turn it off and on again,"" and using their subpar employees to put forth *just enough* effort to justify their price.

A lot of US companies are realizing the shitshow this has become and are slowly turning away from it. But not everyone has been burned yet, so it will be a while before the business model is no longer viable."	FALSE

The [Procedure for amending the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Procedure_for_amending_the_Constitution) is just an extremely high bar.

If you look at the [amendments that were, and particularly those which were not, ratified,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proposed_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Unratified_Amendments), those that were not were more politically controversial.

Plus this system will require 3 injection sites which needed to be rotated and on a varying basis (3 days for pump, 7 days for CGM, etc). If they can make a rapid acting insulin that matches natural insulin I'll be impressed.

115	"Go to Amazon and buy ""Sudden Money: Managing a Financial Windfall"" and read it. Make sure no one from your family finds you reading this book.

You can set up separate trusts for each person you wish to give money to and hire a trustee to manage it. The trustee will manage it according to your wishes and specifications, and can play the 'bad guy'. If the trust is  irrevocable, you literally have zero ability to control the money after funding the trust. So you can make gifts and say, ""this is all the gift you ever get and here's how it works. All of the money is spoken for so there is nothing left after this.""

However.

Your parents are clearly still spending beyond their means. Bailing them out solves nothing and will keep perpetuating the problem. Until their spending is under control, giving them money will have the same effect as giving money to an addict. Your parents need to fail on their own and reform on their own. Save your repayment of your college education for when they are older and less able to care for themselves. Until then, stay out of it.

If I were you, I'd tell no one until you have a handle on what you want to do with this money. You're young. You're going to lose a lot to taxes, and a bit more to doing something (please at least do one thing) dumb.

194	"I think given that one of Balon's major goals was to get revenge on the Starks, it made sense for him to invade the North.

Whether Balon should have tried to legitimise his rule by aligning with one of the other pretenders, I'm not sure, but I think Balon is definitely keen on becoming independent, so maybe he's taking a long-term view here, which limits his alliance options.

Besides, his invasion is very successful - his main mistake being refusing to give Theon a bigger role. In the end Balon isn't even defeated by one of the other factions in the war, but by an unrelated player. After he dies his campaign begins to disintegrate due to the Kingsmoot, Ramsay using Theon to retake Moat Cailin, etc, but before that he performs well going by his own goals (revenge for the Siege of Pyke with the ultimate goal of the Iron Islands going back to the Old Way) and his starting position."

Normally, the minister would say something like this, ""China is a country ruled by law, and has established a humans right council. No country is perfect, and everyone should strive to improve their human rights records. Of course, this is an important issue in China and because there is no single easy way to handle this issue, we ask that everyone reflect and act to improve their own problems before politicizing such issues of other countries.""

242	"Items as a means of balancing is fine, but HotS allows more pinpointed balancing at a specific hero. It's also a more dynamic and engaging way of your hero becoming more powerful throughout the game, as instead of a basic statboost or some extra button to press, it actually can dramatically change how your abilties work. 

In my opinion, and maybe the author's as well, is that it is kind of silly to have an entire role in your game designed to be weaker than the other roles. They are a necessary role, for sure, but one that feels quite weak compared to others. HotS support role is not without issues, but at least you feel that you can contribute more than an aura and maybe a stun most of the time. 

His point about the toplaner is pretty valid I think, in a genre so focused on teamplay, the toplane doesn't do much to contribute until the midgame. In general this is just a big difference between HotS and other MOBAS, because of their objective focused maps, teamfighting and team coordination are encouraged within the first few minutes. Very little laning by yourself for long periods of time.

Lastly, I don't believe he was trying to straight up bash the game and make HotS out to be some saviour of the genre, but what he is saying is that some of the inherently boring, bland, and uninspired game design passed down from the early Starcraft and Warcraft mods, can and have been made more interesting by Heroes of the Storm.

Then he won't show up on day 3.  You'll call him, and he'll promise to be there the next day.  He won't show up either.  He finally will show up on day 5.  He'll try to get you to pay him in advance for the next day, as he's short on cash.  You will refuse.

The specific complaint isn't about who can or can't say it, the complaint is about people who get around not being able to say it by using the pointless euphemism ""the N-word"" when every single person who hears that phrase is immediately going to think ""nigger"". Just like the guy says in the video, you're basically making *me* say it in my head instead of just saying it yourself. All I'm submitting is that if its inappropriate to say ""nigger"" which, lets be honest, it usually is, then its *equally* inappropriate to say ""the N-word"" since I feel the two are absolutely equivalent.

460	"To answer this, we have to go back to the first British naval mission in Greece, under Vice Admiral Tufnell. The aim of the naval mission, established in 1910, was to re-organise the Greek Navy, to supervise and improve training and logistics, and to guide Greek naval procurement towards British yards. Tufnell had encountered several obstacles in carrying out these objectives to his full satisfaction. In May 1913, when the contract for the first mission was up, the Greeks requested that Tufnell and much of his mission be replaced with officers from the active duty list. Rear Admiral Kerr was chosen for this duty. There were several reasons for this - he was a close friend of the First Sea Lord, Prince Louis of Battenberg, and by extension the Royal Family, he was an able professional officer, whom Admiral Fisher described as 'the ablest captain on the Navy List', and he had previously been a naval attache in Greece in 1903-4. Kerr would be joined by 18 other officers, to join the two that had remained from Tufnell's mission. 

The British Admiralty had been disappointed at the obstacles faced by Tufnell. Part of these had come from his status, and it was hoped that Kerr, with his royal and professional connections would avoid these. But to ensure that all other obstacles were swept aside, they insisted that the mission was invested with 'full and effective control' by the Greeks. This had been echoed by the remaining members of the Tufnell mission, who had asked the Greek Government that the new contract for the mission include supervision over all branches of the Navy, along with full control over promotions, appointments, recruitment and training. The Greeks made a counteroffer, which gave members of the mission administrative authority conforming to a decree passed in August 1912 concerning inspections. However, Tufnell felt that this decree, rather than expanding the mission's powers, had been passed to limit them. The British counteroffer suggested that the officers of the mission be granted Greek commissions, for the rank they were to hold in the Greek navy - this way, the British would get the authority they wanted, while the Greeks would effectively retain their sovereignty. By August 1913, the contract for the new mission was ready. While the mission did have to stick to the August 1912 decree limiting their powers, they were also commissioned into the Greek Navy, and were able to hold commands in any squadron or department, with the exception of the Ministry of Marine. The mission had no direct power over appointments, but were required to be consulted before anything could happen. In the event of war, the officers of the mission were not to take any active role, but were to maintain an advisory position. A large amount of power over the Greek Navy was invested in Kerr: he was a member of all committees of the Ministry of Marine, he had access to all confidential reports, he could issue movement orders to any unit of the fleet, and could take preparatory steps towards procuring new material (in addition to his vote on the Committee of Naval Construction). He could also issue orders to any member of the mission. These had a variety of roles, mainly in training and inspection - British officers headed the main training centres for gunnery, torpedoes and officers, while others had inspection powers over aviation, submarines, dockyards and construction, and marine engineering. 

The Kerr mission had several major effects on the Greek Navy in the run-up to WW1. They helped develop the naval Boys School in Poros, an important source for enlisted men. They improved naval logistics, creating a supply dump in Piraeus, and removing corruption within the system. They helped the enlisted, increasing wages, reducing punishments, and establishing canteens aboard ships. They oversaw a great expansion of the Naval Staff, and the Naval Air Service. Naval training was reorganised along British lines, and several British manuals, for things like minesweeping, were introduced. Kerr also attempted to persuade the Greek Navy to move away from capital ships, and towards large flotillas of destroyers and cruisers, to mixed results.

However, their effects on Anglo-Greek naval strategy are somewhat more complex. Under Tufnell, the mission had been trying to draw Britain and Greece together, as anchorages in the Ionian islands would be advantageous for Britain in a war against Austria-Hungary. Alliance with Greece would also help to swing other Mediterranean nations, such as Spain, towards the Entente. However, 1913 brought several changes to the situation which weakened the allure of an Anglo-Greek alliance. The Germans accepted British proposals to reduce the pace of construction. The Austro-Hungarian parliament decided not to build another squadron of dreadnoughts. Windfalls from taxation and from the colony of Malaya meant that the Admiralty could easily build more capital ships without having to ask for higher taxes. All this meant that the British position in the Mediterranean became stronger, as the threat in the North Sea decreased. Meanwhile political developments - mainly the accession to the throne of the pro-German Prince Constantine, but also suggestions that an Anglo-Greek alliance would tighten bonds between Austria and Italy discouraged Britain from alliance with Greece. Meanwhile, the rise of Russia made the Ottoman Empire somewhat more of a tempting target, and an alliance with Greece would only antagonise them. As such, from this point to the start of WW1, the mission concerned itself solely with training and construction. However, Kerr had developed a strong attachment to Greece, and in December 1913 was a strong proponent of assisting them against Turkey over the Aegean islands. Once the war, things became somewhat more complex, due to the complex political schism within Greece. King Constantine was strongly pro-German, but his PM, Eleftherios Venizelos, was strongly pro-Entente. The British were still hoping to keep the Ottoman Empire out of the war, which an alliance with Greece would have greatly jeopardised. As a result, Kerr initially swung his support behind Constantine, supporting his position in council and elsewhere. He helped Constantine draft a statement to the Entente, stating that Greece would not fight Turkey unless attacked. However, he tempered this, reminding Constantine that if Greece was too friendly to the Central Powers, the RN and French Navy could wipe Greece off the map. However, following the Ottoman entry to the war, he swung to Venizelos. Kerr may have had some minor part in the Ottoman entry to the war, which was essentially occasioned by the arrival of the German warships *Goeben* and *Breslau* at Constantinople. There is evidence that Kerr knew where they were heading, as he had been informed of German intentions by Constantine, but failed to pass this to London in time for action to be taken. Through his support for Venizelos, Kerr helped gain permission for an Anglo-French force to land at Salonika to aid the Serbs.

Kerr remained in Greece until September 1915. In March 1915, he had developed rheumatism, which by May had become bad enough that he requested permission to return home to recuperate. He was granted temporary leave at the end of the summer, but would never return. With him gone, the naval mission somewhat collapsed. The Greek admirals began to reassert their control over the Greek Navy. In 1917, with Greece fully under the control of Venizelos rather than the monarchy, the Greeks requested another naval mission. However, Admiral Coundouriotes, the Greek C-in-C, would not allow himself to be superseded by a British officer, so Captain Clifton Brown was chosen to lead it. Brown's mission arrived in December 1917, but would leave in 1919, thanks to accusations of meddling with Greek politics. There were five more British missions in the period from 1919 to 1932, as well as several more following WW2. The British had very little impact on the Greek Army. There was a French military mission to Greece which would have had a greater effect on the Army, but I know very little about it.

Now, for the love of God, wtf are those calculations? Are you saying that unless DE was in the EZ, the South would have 5% inflation? &amp; why do you think so? And if we take your numbers as correct, why do we have one of the highest (if not the highest) inflation rate in the EZ? 

I simply can't understand the logic behind the numbers. 

(Total EZ GDP - German GDP) * (Southern inflation in another parallel reality - German inflation) = subsidies to Germany bcz why not.

Private hospitals (which of course the poor cannot afford) are staffed and funded very well.

The only bit of info one could potentially categorize as liberal bias was the comment at the end of the piece that the country was rife with corruption and that the government had lost more than what the doctors' raises would cost in some sort of corruption scheme recently.

The only reason that colonialism and the slave trade could exist was that these countries were *already* enormously powerful compared to the others. So, you're already wrong.

You could even argue that many of the countries that were colonized are actually better off now (at least economically) than they would have been without colonization.

I'm not a parent, but I have been made godfather to four kids.

And to think that she is the only person I know who has a singing voice *worse* than her mother's... Yeeesh, but those are some tone-deaf genetics at work.)

So my advice would be this... He's got a *lot* of growing up between now and 18. And as youthful fascinations tend to die off with time, all of this might be for naught. (If it does, at least he will have some useful language skills in his back pocket. Those look good on college applications anywhere.)

So that interest you made by moving the money (which is a terrible idea first off because it makes you look implicit in fraud, especially if it's to a short term savings, even if you alert the bank) is not legally yours and belongs to the bank. I'm not sure why people don't get this very simple concept but it seems to always come up where people think that making interest on money not yours is some magical loophole. There's actually precedent of these cases happening that would even be used as secondary authority in an issue like this that I've researched on westlaw for my financial law class and every single case is decided in favor of the bank.

Mob Psycho was amazing as well, and LL! Sunshine ended up leagues better than the first seasons.

**Worst Anime: Battery** (Dropped episode 1) - Boring and melodramatic. I tried to watch through the second episode as well, but couldn't get myself to finish it.

**Best Surprise Anime: Mob Psycho 100** (9/10), **HM: Love Live Sunshine** (8/10) - I knew Mob Psycho would be good going in, but I ended up liking it far more than I initially expected. Sunshine, too, surpassed my expectations by being better than the first two seasons in just about every aspect.

**Most Disappointing Anime: Battery** (Dropped episode 1), **DM: Orange** (6/10) - I had my hopes up for Battery, hoping for a sports show that would be more similar to Ping Pong. Needless to say, I was pretty damn let down. I actually ended up enjoying Orange; the beginning and ending were great, but the problems that arose in the middle from poor production values really dragged it down a lot.

Can you still use F&amp;R fine even with tanked Stability? Sure, but it's tougher than the likes of Palindrome, which has similar Recoil Direction but a lot more Stability.

The first ancient coinage to paper money today is accepted because of a simple reason, it is what the government collects taxes in. Everyone pays taxes (theoretically) so every needs coins.

So the satellites to be built for the Internet constellation may already have a lot of the hardware that would be needed for the timekeeping functions that you describe.

In the case of pavel, he's not really wrong. Pavel has made some of the worst mistakes we've ever seen in big tournaments and benefited from some of the most insane RNG. It's been pretty hard to revel at his deck building/preparation because it is usually just the standard list everyone expects people to bring and his bans are often very curious (maybe pavel could comment on this himself) because they are generally regarded as being wrong.

782	"Okay I'm gonna go with a pragmatic answer on this one. 

First of all, video games are a unique media. Like you point out, there's pretty much no other piece of entertainment that can be modified after it comes out. Even if blu-ray remasters or director cuts exists, it doesn't change the version you have on your DVD or whatever. Therefor I think it would be a huge mistake to ignore the potential that it brings to the gamers and the developers. Especially when you see how hard it is to create a game, it gives developers a little bit more chances to improve their product if bugs were shipped or the game isn't as balanced as they want it to be (and also to make more money). It's completely unique to video games, and it's a powerful tool.

Now, is it a good or bad thing? My point of view is that it depends. Some games became worse after release, other became better. Game developers can keep adding features, squashing bugs, improving performance months or even years after release. It also help a game staying playable for a long time (try playing a VHS nowadays, you're gonna have a hard time finding a VCR, but games can potentially be patched to support new platforms, new hardware years after their release if they want to). Personally I think the majority of changes after release are beneficial to the gamers, but I don't have hard statistics on that.

However I want to point out one thing. A game usually costs 60$. That's the equivalent of 5-6 movie tickets. Since some multiplayer games will provide you with hundred of hours, if not thousand of hours of game, I think it's a pretty freaking good deal. I wouldn't mind too much if a game dev kills a game I like with terrible patches after a couple of months, or if the community dies out because of unbalanced gameplay or whatever. It sucks, sure. But if I got 50 or 60+ hours of fun before that happens, I'm definitely not gonna complain. "	FALSE

Why *wouldn't* he include his political opinions in his stand-up routines and on his twitter feed?? It's something he enjoys, and something he clearly wants to include with his material, but on stage and on Twitter. That's his choice. It's his career. And it seems to be working out *just* fine for him. ;)

Not all comedians are interested in politics, and that's fine... But Paton Oswalt is.

If you don't like it... you can just not pay attention to him. Perhaps he's not to your taste as much as you seem to think.

And when did we get from discomfort to repulsive? Let me explain this with an analogy, I'm a vegetarian who worked in a kitchen and and sometimes as a waiter during uni. While there I had to prepare a lot of dishes which had meat in them. But since it was my job, I prepared them, and quite happily so, since it paid for my rent and food. When watering, it was my job to make the customer happy, so I bought the same dishes to their tables happily.

She was proposing a no fly zone over Syria which is basically an act of war against Russia. She is awful. Trump and Clinton are near the bottom of the barrel as far as presidential candidates go, but Clinton is just worse. To be honest I don't think I could craft a worse candidate then Hillary Clinton from my perspective (anarcho-capatalist), she is the worst of both the left and the right. She played into the identity politics narrative, she is for big government for entitlements and she is pro war. The only possible thing she could be worse on is if she was still ant-gay (which she was in the recent past lol). She is just fucking awful and I am glad she isn't president. Trump is going to be an awful president and blows, but he isn't literally the worst president ever concocted like Clinton is.	FALSE

835	"There are many different ethical debates surrounding eugenics. 
I assume you're referring to the question as to whether it's ethical to artificially alter the gene pool ie. remove the human rights of certain groups?

However, before you even get to that point, to equate unquestionably the exclusion of the groups OP talked about as 'improving' (rather than altering) the gene pool suggests an acceptance of the idea that those groups are by default inferior. This suggests the issue of ethical debate is whether inferior groups should have their human rights removed, rather than questioning the core notion that those groups are inferior. 

A discussion about eugenics needs first to establish that the notion of genetic inferiority is wildly subjective, but is/was defined differently by different societies; for example, Nazi ideology deemed Jewish people, disabled people or homosexual people as inferior.

I know this is is a question of nuance and was probably not intentional by OP but if we aren't careful of how to word the discussion we risk not challenging insidious ideas such as the fact that the above mentioned social groups are automatically 'lesser' somehow. "	FALSE

958	"Apparently, due to differences in body-fat the 'average' lean man has an 80 per cent chance of sinking, while the average lean woman has only a 40 per cent chance. The ordeal by water appears to have been first invented in 9th century when it was normally used for criminal and occasional civil cases (first used for witches in the 11th century; but uncommon for such a charge until the 16th century) where there was insufficient evidence to determine guilt. In these instances those undergoing the ordeal were fettered and placed in a pool of water. Many medieval churches had pools for this purpose and a priest had to be present (they received a fee). Take this with pinch of salt but it has been argued that it afforded a degree of latitude against conviction. Thus in a sample of 91 ordeals conducted on 84 men and 7 women in England from the the late 12th to the early 13th century, 79 of the men faced the cold-water ordeal but no women (Peter Leeson argues that this indicates the benign rigging of the ordeal system by selection). When these ordeals were forbidden in 1215, they were replaced by torture.

During the swimming test, (or ducking, 'fleeting upon the water', etc.; you can see a picture of it [here](http://www.strangehistory.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/witch-ducking.jpg)) the suspect was commonly naked with each thumb tied to a toe on the opposite foot. The trial was rooted in popular culture and part of the pre-trial process. Most who underwent it were 'marginal women'. Even if they passed the test, they certainly faced health risks and women died as a result; in these instances of throwing often numerous women into rivers it functioned as torture.

Most jurists regarded the test as illegal and it was officially forbidden in the Spanish Netherlands and in France but still practiced until the 19th century in some regions. In fact 'witch hunts were rare, localised, and short lived, most began due to a temporary weakness of state authority and ended when state authority was reasserted.'

974	"Hi there,

I'm trying to follow along but the message is a little jumbled, OP. It's perfectly fine, I'll manage. Let me know if I'm missing anything:

1. You are thinking about suicide and what kind of note you want to leave behind.
2. You hate yourself and self-harm.
3. Your friend took his life about a year ago, and since then things have gone downhill.

How was life before your friend took his own life? How about right after that happened? 

Losing a friend to suicide is very hard. There are a lot of ""what-if"" type questions and guilt often associated with it. The ""I don't understand"" perfectly captures the reaction the people around the person have.

I've lost someone to suicide, myself, and I went through the exact same motions. The crying every day, the lack of motivation to do things, trouble sleeping and eating, the lack of energy to get up in the morning. I went into grief counseling for it. Have you ever been to counseling yourself? Sometimes the best way to mourn the loss of a loved one is to have a conversation about what that loss means to you, and how you can move on from there. That's what the heart of grief counseling is all about.

It sounds like you've been through quite a lot in addition to your friend passing. In my experience, such horrible experiences often also bring to light other types of stressors that come up as well. It feels as if everything gets placed on your shoulders, and it's far too heavy for you to hold up for long.

Speak up about what you're feeling. There is help out there for you. Sometimes it's all about getting the courage to find it.

Best of luck!"	FALSE

2.  College league with my old school buddies (4 player overlap with main money league).  12-team Standard Scoring. $20 buy in.
3.  My /r/NarFFL league.  12-team PPR Scoring. There's no money involved here but the idea of making my way to the top of the pile has been really motivating.  Competition has been great.  Managed to pull off Farm to Majors in 4 years!  
4.  My /r/FTAFFL league.  Fantasy football summer camp.  I like this one because it's a slow email draft in July/August and it gets the juices flowing.  14-Team Half-PPR scoring. $0 buy in, 1st/2nd gets a small payout.

I've gone from 1 league up to as many as 7 over the last 10 years, and I think being in these 4 is the sweet spot for me.  Everyone is different though!  Ultimately you have to care about your league or the weekly maintenance will become a chore.

The author of the chart then layered on the policy announcements of BC, Alberta, and Ontario to get the red line in the chart. These policies are in various stages of development but are *not all funded*.

So the author has used a different methodology than Environment Canada by including announced, unfunded policies.

&gt; The man who President-elect Donald Trump will nominate as the 84th attorney general of the United States was once rejected as a federal judge over allegations he called a black attorney “boy,” suggested a white lawyer working for black clients was a race traitor, joked that the only issue he had with the Ku Klux Klan was their drug use, and referred to civil rights groups as “un-American” organizations trying to “force civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.”

&gt; J. Gerald Hebert remembers Sessions’ time as the top federal prosecutor in Mobile, Alabama, well. Speaking to The Huffington Post earlier this month, Hebert said he was stunned that an Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a possibility.

&gt; [...]

&gt; After Sessions was nominated to be a federal judge in 1986, Hebert appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify about these remarks. It was unusual for a career DOJ lawyer to testify about a judicial nominee’s character, and Hebert said at the time that he did so with “very mixed feelings,” telling senators he considered Sessions “a friend.” Hebert told them Sessions had “a tendency to pop off” and that he was “not a very sensitive person when it comes to race relations.”

&gt; HuffPost reviewed a transcript of the Sessions’ 1986 confirmation hearings. In this selection, Hebert testified that he had once relayed comments about a white lawyer being described as a race traitor, and that Sessions had responded by saying “he probably is”: 

&gt; http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/582ddf4c1700002600e7b052.jpeg

&gt; Sessions testified that he did not believe he had made such a remark, but his views changed as he reflected.

&gt; “The best I could recall was that I said, well, he is not that popular around town; I have heard him referred to as a disgrace to his race,” Sessions said. He said he did not personally believe that the white civil rights attorney was a race traitor, and that he had respect for him.

&gt; Sessions testified that he enjoyed the “free flow of ideas” and liked to stir it up with Hebert when he was in town. “I like to discuss things. I am open: I like to discuss with liberals better than I do with conservatives,” Sessions said.

&gt; In describing one conversation with Hebert on civil rights, Sessions articulated his view that things were pretty great for minorities in the 1980s and that civil rights organizations were asking for too much.

&gt; “I made the comment that the fundamental legal barriers to minorities had been knocked down, and that in many areas blacks dominate the political area, and that when the civil rights organizations or the ACLU participate in asking for things beyond what they are justified in asking, they do more harm than good,” Sessions testified.

&gt; That’s not exactly how Hebert recalled it:

&gt; http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/582de0bd1800006a0730ea81.jpeg

&gt; [...]

&gt; Figures also testified that Sessions and two others in the office referred to him as “boy.” Figures said he couldn’t say anything about it to Sessions because his position with him was “tentative.”

&gt; “I felt that if I had said anything or reacted in a manner in which thought appropriate, I thought I would be fired,” Figures said. “I had to guard my reaction to things, Senator, because I needed a job at the time... So I took a lot of things; I just kept it inside.”

&gt; Sessions “categorically” denied using the term “boy” to refer to Figures. “I have never used the word ‘boy’ to describe a black, nor would I tolerate it in my office,” Sessions testified.

&gt; Hebert said Figures’ testimony would be consistent with the views he believes Sessions holds.

&gt; “He demonstrated gross insensitivity to black people. So Tom Figures reporting that he had been called ‘boy’ by Jeff Sessions, that wouldn’t surprise me at all,” Hebert told HuffPost.

&gt; [...]

&gt; Sessions also remarked that he thought the KKK was OK until he found out they smoked marijuana, according to Figures. The statement was made in connection with the prosecution of a Klan member who had hanged a black man. From Figures’ testimony:

&gt; http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/582dfbc21700002500e7b0c2.jpeg

&gt; Questioned at the time by now-Vice President Joe Biden, Sessions admitted to the comments and said they were intended humorously.

&gt; http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/582e02ef1a00002400cc87d0.jpeg

&gt; http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/582e29c2180000ca0330ebc5.jpeg

&gt; Biden also asked Sessions about the allegation that he had used a racial slur after a court hearing when he was in private practice. (The term appears uncensored in the transcript below. The U.S. Senate didn’t approve C-SPAN cameras until later that year.)

&gt; http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/582e2c0b1a00002400cc8878.jpeg

&gt; Sessions’ nomination was ultimately defeated in June 1986, making him the first Reagan nominee the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected.

Also, [Deval Patrick has urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Sessions](http://www.wbur.org/politicker/2017/01/03/patrick-sessions-letter):

&gt; Patrick in 1985 represented one of three community activists that came to be known as the ""Perry County Three"" who were being targeted by federal prosecutors for alleged voting fraud. The case was being prosecuted by then-U.S. Attorney Sessions.

&gt; Patrick wrote that the presiding judge in the case made clear at the trial's outset that it was not a federal crime for someone to help someone else vote or advise them how to vote if such help is requested. Sessions, according to Patrick, opted to pursue the case anyway and focused his investigation on absentee balloting by black voters in districts where white incumbents were losing political ground despite the widespread use of absentee ballots by white voters and their advocates.

&gt; ""To use prosecutorial discretion to attempt to criminalize voter assistance is wrong and should be disqualifying for any aspirant to the Nation's highest law enforcement post,"" Patrick wrote.

&gt; All three defendants in the case were ultimately acquitted by a jury. Patrick said that despite a reputation for plea bargaining criminal cases, Sessions refused to consider a deal in the voting rights case. Sessions listed the case on his questionnaire for the Senate Judiciary Committee as one of the 10 most significant litigation matters in which he has been involved, along with another case that he prosecuted in Alabama involving the intimidation of and discrimination against black voters.

&gt; Noting that Sessions' nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986 was withdrawn ""on a bipartisan basis,"" Patrick suggests that a ""similar outcome"" would be appropriate this time around.

And the [NAACP organized a sit-in to protest the nomination](http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/3/14158144/naacp-jeff-sessions-sit-in):

&gt; The key victory for voting rights during the civil rights movement of the 1960s was the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law allowed the federal government to supervise state-run elections, particularly in states that have a history of discriminating against black voters. Its passage and enforcement quickly led to huge improvements in black voter registration and turnout in Southern states.

&gt; https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QWZWnKqbH6J8TJbj0ZLl3K0teuc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7743715/VRA_effects.png

&gt; Sessions, however, does not appear to view the law as a big victory. He previously called the Voting Rights Act a “piece of intrusive legislation.” And after a Supreme Court decision in 2013 massively weakened the Voting Rights Act, he opposed efforts to update the law so the federal government could continue to oversee voting laws in places with histories of discrimination.

&gt; Sessions, in fact, denied that Shelby County, Alabama — which brought the challenge against the Voting Rights Act to the Supreme Court — ever had a history of discrimination against black voters. “Shelby County has never had a history of denying voters and certainly not now,” he claimed after the 2013 Supreme Court ruling.

&gt; Shelby County and Alabama have a long history of discrimination of all kinds — the kind of discrimination the Voting Rights Act set out to combat. And the Supreme Court’s decision allowed Alabama to pass a strict voter ID law in time for the 2016 election — a policy that makes it harder for minority voters in particular to cast a ballot, since they’re less likely to have IDs and more likely to face hurdles to obtaining one.

&gt; As a federal prosecutor, Sessions also used concerns about voter fraud — which is extremely rare — to go after activists registering black voters. In the 1980s, he prosecuted Albert Turner for alleged voter fraud after Turner helped black voters register in Alabama, earning the nickname “Mr. Voter Registration.” The charges fell flat, with a jury deliberating for less than three hours before finding Turner not guilty of all counts of mail fraud, altering absentee ballots, and conspiracy to vote more than once. This moment is very telling: These kinds of court challenges would be tried time and time again by conservative lawmakers and prosecutors, even in 2016, to stop black voter registration efforts."

I remember reading that whenever women's magazines, like Cosmo, release their hottest men of (insert year), it is usually a tall, six pack donning, white man. Very few are short or dark-skinned. Back home in South Africa, I once heard of a mixed race (they are referred to as ""coloured"") woman who had been divorced and hopped back onto the cock carousel.

She had a kid, she was in her mid 30s and having fun, but lamented the lack of ""rich white men"" around. She believed she deserved an upgrade but without offering a rich man a deal that he could not resist. On the other hand, Asian countries are generally seen as slim pickings for western women. Women who head to China or South Korea tend to date other westerners while Western men have no qualms dating and sleeping with Asian women. Asian women also desire the Western men either because of their (alleged) sexual prowess or the possibility of leaving their country and getting citizenship elsewhere.

This says a lot about Western women's preferences that they don't find Asian men appealing at all. While there are instances of western women who date Asian men, it is mostly western men who pursue relationships with Asians. It is one thing to prefer a small percentage of men, but when women don't want men from their own ethnicity, it makes dating that much harder for non white men.

1280	"It is not often mentioned, but Australia is currently the world's fourth-largest importer of private firearms. There is something of a mis-conception about quite what the new licensing scheme accomplished. They hit a landmark earlier this year in that there are now more firearms in Australia than there were before the Port Arthur shooting. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-28/australia-has-'more-guns-than-before-port-arthur-massacre'/7366360

You will note that /u/talondearg 's post is rather careful/specific in its wording. If you want to buy a Glock semi-auto pistol today, it'll set you back about AU$1,000 at your local Aussie gun show, which will surprise a number of people. (See TV news piece here from Sydney gun show this year: https://www.facebook.com/7newssydney/videos/1296324183725045 ) The licensing scheme is somewhat more restrictive than it is in the US, but neither is it the total prohibition which many people seem to claim. Semi-auto rifles may be banned, but not everything else. Like Talon, I am not going to get drawn into the political merits or effects of the current scheme. I merely observe that there remains a practical use for firearms amongst famers, bushmen, etc, and that sport shooting is still a supported practice.

The other point I'd note is that although there may not have been 'widespread' and 'politically effective' opposition to the new Australian scheme, there was mass non-compliance. It is estimated that only a third of the applicable firearms (And about 20% of the self-loading rifles) were actually turned in. Last week, the Aussie government announced an amnesty for the estimated quarter-million illegally held firearms. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-guns-idUSKCN12L0P8

It is interesting to consider that the firearms laws in nearby and, I would think, culturally similar New Zealand are substantially looser than in Australia, and makes a fascinating counterpoint. In fact, a Kiwi friend of mine owns firearms which are illegal here in California. Also of interest, weapons are not registered in New Zealand: Firearms owners are the ones vetted to authorise certain classes of weapons, not the weapons themselves. If they're considered 'good to own a semi-auto', then they can use their permit to buy as many as they like. The government doesn't track them. 

As an Irishman, I would note that the firearms prohibition did not seem to preclude the import onto the island of Armalites, ARs and Kalashnikovs for the purposes of general mayhem up North. More difficult, sure, but the water was not a practical stop."	FALSE

1289	"&gt;I don't think it's the definitions but rather the nature of the universe.

Of the material universe, yes.

&gt;Take common descent for example. If we were able to resurrect all things that have ever lived and lay them out in chronological order, you could not point to where one species ended and the next began. The definitions are completely arbitrary. They simply appear easier due to extinction and quantity. It's all a seamless continuum of evolving matter. ""Species"" are more like periods of stability than actual categories.

More or less, exactly this, yes.

&gt;And therein lies the problem. Is there a perfect mule form or is a mule a diminished horse/donkey? It's a matter of perspective. 

Well, the problem lies with what we are saying has an essence.

Species qua species do not have essences. But I think the easiest example of essentialism, which most persons tacitly assent to, is chemical essentialism. Gold has an essence- a particular arrangement of matter that it is defined by, and does not deviate from, lest it just be some other *kind* of thing.

Kinds and species are not the same thing. Aristotle's mistake was rejecting the proto-evolutionary ideas he criticized- though he was right to criticize them as they were posed. Aquinas followed in his footsteps, and I think that many Thomists make the same mistake, but are not wrong to be essentialists (in the medieval sense)- they're just essentialists about the wrong things, viz. species.

Kinds are what carve nature at its joints. Species are fuzzy, arbitrarily made distinctions for the sake of instrumentality. It's instrumental to distinguish between homo sapiens and other species, but they are not different in kind by virtue of being a different species.

Rather, the quality of being they realize by virtue of their material constitution (whether actualized, or in potency due to immaturity, material frustration, or deterioration) is different in kind from the other animals on earth. 

It's not *homo sapiens* that have an essence- it's human beings that have an essence. And human beings simply are beings that realize (have the inherent potential due to their material constitution) humanity- that is, rational self-consciousness.

Homo sapiens are not identical with their humanity. It is something they possess. It is not homo sapiens per se that has an essence, but rather, homo sapiens qua human beings.

&gt;The universe is fluid. 

The world of material particulars, yes.

&gt;There don't seem to be any essential qualities because it's all one blossoming thing branching out from a singularity.

1331	"&gt; The deification of Jesus was one major problem

So you're referring to *the* [Ebionites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebionites), correct? A group we have no evidence for until the middle of the second century? That's more than fifty years after Paul. So where's the evidence this group and their beliefs were ever contemporary with Paul?

&gt; In Paul's epistles, we get sola fide, and in the Epistle of James, we get salvation via works.

We don't get sola fide from Paul's epistles, we get it from Lutheranism. ""Sola fide"" means ""faith alone"". James uses that phrase to argue against it. Protestants got ""faith alone"" from a Lutheran interpretation of this passage in Ephesians 2: ""For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God—not the result of works, so that no one may boast.""

Luther inserted the word ""alone"" after ""saved through faith"", and the idea stuck. But *right after this* Paul says ""For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works"". In other words, we're saved by faith in order to do good works. In Paul's theology faith necessarily leads to works; no works means no faith. That's exactly what James says in his letter.

&gt; You know what they say, history is written by the victors.

The existing evidence undermines your point, so you just dismiss all of that evidence as invalid, while making an argument from silence.

&gt; The Ebionites were more concerned about Jesus' life and teachings

According to what?

&gt; Paul more concerned about his resurrection

Again, your OP *begins your argument* by relying on the synoptics, but each synoptic Gospel devotes nearly a quarter of their narrative to Jesus' death and resurrection, and each one repeatedly alludes or mentions it in the first three-fourths of their narratives. The basic framework of the synoptics' soteriology is no different than Paul's soteriology.

&gt; The Resurrection was added later to the Gospels.

You just shot yourself in the foot, because no academic scholar would take this claim seriously. This isn't a theory based on evidence, it's a conspiracy based on leaps of your imagination.

&gt; Galatians 3 is all about downplaying the law in favour of faith. Jesus emphatically disagrees (Matthew 5:17-20) and so does his brother, who promotes works over faith.

Context. Context, context, context. Paul is writing to *gentiles*, not Jews. Jesus was talking to *Jews*, not gentiles. James was writing to *Jews*, not gentiles.

I don't have the statistics for that portion.

Plus, in terms of perception of injustice, I would hazard a guess that non-violent drug arrests create more resentment than violent crime arrests, where there is some obvious reason to incarcerate.

Finally, it would be interesting to see statistics regarding what percentage of violent criminals' first arrests were non-violent drug charges. Also a chicken and egg causation problem, but I think it also plays a part."	FALSE

1378	"It will certainly be considered in Control Priest.

It's far more reliable than Injured Blademaster, who requires a Circle of Healing to get his value.

However, unlike Blademaster, he does not generate as much value.

Taking 2 damage at the start of each turn makes him, in a sense, 'impossible to heal'.

Hitting 2 HP during the enemy turn means death.

So, in essence, he's a 3/5 card that the Priest can't heal for 3 mana. But dies if the Priest does not spend an 'upkeep' cost.

I'm trading 2 mana per turn for a slightly above curve minion.

Now, against 2/3's, that 1 HP makes alllll the difference.

But there's a lot of 3 attack creatures out there. At best this fellow will trade 2 for 1. Though at worst I see him trading 1 for 1 (we all know how big of a deal 5 HP on turn 3 is. Our friendly councilbuddy taught us that important lesson).

For one thing, even on the very slight chance that Dems don't take the Senate back, there is absolutely zero chance that Republicans get enough seats to override a filibuster, so none of those Heritage Foundation approved justices will ever make it to the court.  Secondly, only Ginsburg and Kennedy are even remotely close to being old enough to worry about, and Kennedy isn't exactly a reliable liberal vote to begin with.  Having Ginsburg's seat flip is the absolute worst case scenario, and while that's bad, remember, the Senate straight up won't allow another Alito or Thomas to make it to the court.  Ain't gonna happen.  The kind of conservative who could get confirmed would be someone more in the vein of Roberts, who has plenty of things to dislike but has not been even close to a disaster.

No. I wanted to know what you meant by rape porn since you said you imagine most Americans oppose rape porn. 

I would not be surprised if he started enforcing old laws or using his own interpretation on current laws (which are subjective or open ended) which would allow him to attempt to restrict or ban porn. That being said, I find it highly unlikely. TL;DR Wouldn't be surprised but don't expect it.

Nope. Fatalism is that something is destined to be, regardless of what happens--as in Greek myths where, no matter what you do, or don't do, to avoid some prophecy (fate), it happens anyway. Determinism is that, given a particular state of affairs, precisely one another state of affairs follows. Fatalism is thus a much stronger thesis than determinism.

&gt;Well... you'd have to do some pretty intense intellectual gymnastics to deny it, given the profound and plentiful simularities between Old Testament stories and the yet older tales spread by the surrounding cultures.

Yes. Watch me do some intense intellectual gymnastics. You can't prove those are older, and I don't believe that they were. Or, at the very least, the myths came from the very events which did occur before them, and were recorded in the Bible. 

Wow, I think I pulled a mental hammy. 


&gt;For an example, the Epics of Gilgamesh speaks of a global flood to drown everyone and everything except for one guy, his family, and every animal species. That guy, Ut-Napishtim, was to build a multistory ark in order to make this possible. He did so, after a bit of whining, and a great rain caused the water to rise above all land.


&gt;Ut-Napishtim used birds to scout out some dry land and finally stepped onto a Middle-eastern mountain, whereat he sacrificed an animal to the Babylonian gods. The gods expressed their genuine sorrow, and life began anew.

Or, it could be, that the epic of Gilgamesh is actually based on the real tale of the worldwide flood and Noah, but the people got the details wrong because it was written long enough after that details had been changed. Interestingly there are many many flood stories in ancient times. You seem to believe that this means the Bible stole the story from them. I simply believe that they have so many stories because this event actually happened.

He didn't have complete control over the music or independence of the entire album like a solo album does, in a group or duo, all that weight is shared and isn't placed so much on one person. I think if he had a solo album as good as ATLiens, that'd more harder to do and more respectable in a sense. Not to discredit the amazing contributions Outkast has made of course. Im just saying its apples to oranges kind of. It's harder and has more pressure to make a good solo album than a group album. 

The Love Below was pretty good, some great songs. But it's not phenomenal or as good as previous Outkast stuff. So he hasn't really made a 10/10 album that wasn't without the help of another rapper (Big Boi), this also mineralizes the chance of a bad verse or etc because you have someone else to fill that space with you. 

Dropping an amazing verse once a year isn't hard fir a guy like Andre since he 1) is so talented and 2) can stash them up &amp; edit them for as long as he wants. It's much harder to make a solo album of consistently great-amazing verses, and to make that album balance cohesion with variety (among other criteria specific to albums). 

He alone hasn't made an album, nor is in the position to put down artists who got help with some lines on their albums when he himself hasn't been in that position. Making a solo album requires more than making an album with  other member(s) isn't as hard as making a solo album. Especially when you barely put out music as is, barely even drop features at all.

“There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit. The poison of vipers is on their lips. Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace they do not know. There is no fear of God before their eyes.”

The thing is you can't ever be considered worthy to God. No matter how much you try to be worthy and do things to be worthy to him. Because if you had to prove your ""worthiness"" than it would've been by your strength and not by God's grace. Moreover, as we go down in Romans...

Romans 3:21-24

""But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.""

God will not reject you if you accept Jesus Christ as your savior, because through Jesus you are seen perfect, holy, and righteous. And its only by and through Jesus you are seen holy by God. What this means is, in God's eyes he sees you as Jesus, and whatever Jesus has done so have you. He says to you ""Well done, good and faithful servant!"" And this all thanks to God's grace and what Jesus has done for us. Also i think it is important to mention the next couple of verses as well. 

Romans 3:27-31

""Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith. Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law."" 

The way I interpret this is we are justified by our faith in Jesus, and not by our works; however, that doesn't mean we are to sin freely/disobey the law. Rather we should try to uphold the commands God has given us. And if we mess up or fall short, it is okay because we are still righteous through Jesus. It is not ""we love God first then God loves us"" but rather ""because God loved us first, we love God"" (1 John 4:19). Also when we slip or fall God is always there ready to forgive you. Spurgeon has this amazing quote, ""The eyes of mercy are quicker than the eyes of repentance. Even the eyes of our faith is dim compared with the eye of God's love. He sees a sinner long before a sinner sees Him ... Slow are the steps of repentance, but swift are the feet of forgiveness. God can run where we scarcely limp, and if we are limping towards Him, He will run towards us.""

God loves you so much!! And to believe God doesn't love you hurts him so! John Owen said, ""The greatest sorrow and burdern you can lay on the Father, the greatest unkindness is not to believe that he loves you."" He has killed his one and only son for you, and because you don't meet certain requirements/levels of ""worthiness"" doesn't mean he will reject you, rather because you can never reach those standards he has sent his son for you.

1608	"847 resto 8/10 mythic here, I'll tackle G'Hanir first.  When activated it increases the speed at which your HoT's tick, however it does not reduce the amount of time that they have remaining. Essence of G'Hanir affects all Hot's that are currently active, as well as all hots that are applied while Essence is active.  It's best used when hots are already up and hots are applied after casting it. Interesting note, it does not affect Tranquility, so don't cast essence/tranq expecting a super heal.

Flourish increases the time remaining of all hots that are currently active by 6 seconds.  It has no affect on hots cast after you hit flourish.  There's a couple best case scenario's for flourish, but they mostly involved raid damage.  If the tank's HoTs are all about to expire and you don't have the GCD's available to refresh them, hit flourish to buy yourself some time.  Even better, in times of heavy raid damage you can use Wild Growth and then immediately flourish for an 11 second WG.  This has a great synergy with the Soul of the Forest talent, which increases the potency of WG after a swiftmend.

Once people arrive on Mars, or even in Mars orbit, that changes. Most of the time people will not EVA to do mining. In stead, they will teleoperate the mining equipment in real time, from within their dome or cave. Ping time for equipment on the surface of Mars, operated by people in domes, is no more than a few milliseconds. Instead of relaxing with a video game in the evenings, I think a lot of people will pick up some extra cash, operating mining equipment, remotely controlled through a video game console.

1659	"I don't think we should go to 2%. It wouldn't work politically or financially in our current climate. I would very much support increase military funding, but I don't think its a smart idea to increase our deficits significantly to pay for it. That said, I would support a GST increase for such a thing.

Secondly, I'm not sure our current position warrants that amount of military spending, anyways. Honestly, NATO is already all powerful compared to its traditional adversaries and if every country spent 2%, I'm just not sure what that would accomplish exactly. Its an arbitrary number and while I very much support our NATO membership, it shouldn't dictate our domestic policies too much. I have no issue with how willing we are to contribute to NATO, given our roles in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Libya in comparison to our allies and I disagreed with 2 of those contributions in the first place.

Thirdy, I think Trump's policies contradict the very nature of why the US spends so much and contributes so much to NATO in the first place. In return for massive military supremacy, they receive soft and hard power. He's said Obama has made the US weak. He's said he wants to increase the military budget and improve the navy but relinquish the US' soft/hard power at the same time? Hmm. They already have a godly amount of military capability to significantly over power any foe on the horizon including China and Russia at the same time. So, why increase if not for the soft power over NATO countries?

Fourthly, throwing money at the military will fix zero problems. Its a structural issue from the inside. The military is apathetic and lethargic in its current state. The waste is astronomical and the military has no idea what it is, what its purpose and what its supposed to do. For the amount of money we currently spend, we should be a lot more competent than we are. But we aren't. Because Parliament hasn't sat down with the DND seriously and set out a mission goal of where to go from here. 

Procurement is a huge issue where a lot of the waste goes, pay and benefits take up most of the budget and the military is extremely top heavy due to all the years of patchwork policies. Instead of throwing money here and there based on the mission of the day, have some clear cut goals on what the end goals of procurement are, constantly looking to fill the gaps in capability in peacetime. There is also little problems here and there like the way postings work, we move people around and waste everyone's money in the process for no reason, more often than not. 

So, what I would like to see is our government gives a serious look at the military. We should be looking to fix waste and put money into clearly defined goals. Focus on defending Canada and how best to design our army/air force/navy around that concept and go from there. Consistently update and evaluate the military every year or so to keep focus. Essentially, cut the fat and put the military on the treadmill. There is plenty of examples around the world of militaries that do more with less because they are more or less politically united on military policy. Our baseline unitary policy should be that we want an elite, modernized, well equipped and efficient military. The size of it is what we can debate on.

Do away with the notion that the CF is a jobs program and a way to ensure we have a handful of jobs at Irving Shipyards every 20 odd years (amongst several examples). The economic benefits are very insignificant, its a policy based in optics and not practicality and Canadian defence companies are sharks who only take the money and still maximize profits. You may support a policy like this with a pseudo nationalistic outlook, but Irving and others have shown they don't give a shit about Canadian jobs and nationalism. They don't even try anymore because we gurantee them a contract based on the fact they're Canadian. Domestic industry is a side effect to a well financed military, not the goal of it. Frankly, we will never have enough money pumping into our military to support financing all spectrums of the defence industry so we need to focus our efforts on only a few capabilities. I would say we focus on the land vehicles/equipment section and look foreign for our air force and navy because other allied countries far eclipse our industries. For example, look to the US for our air force needs and the UK or South Korea for our navy. We should aggressively be looking to establish defence corroborations with our closest allies, they are always looking. Throw our industry a bone by grabbing licencing for some procurement but don't depend on it or legally require them to do it. If Canadians want to compete, than force them to compete. Make it known that military contracts are not for Canadian companies but rather for the best valued product. If that were to be Canadian, then that's a bonus but not a requirement.

I'd also like to see the military budget locked in for years and give it protection from budget raids when the government of that day screws up somewhere else.

TLDR

1, we greatly improve budget efficiency all the way up to top brass 

2, every couple/few years we continue to look at where the military is going and what its purpose. Reform the military to improve effectiveness. Lock in the military budget on a 5/10/15 year basis to prevent budget raiding and allow the DND to confidently know how many resources they have and for how long.

3, design our military around the basic concept of defending Canada and add on capability all around for overseas missions 

4, fix procurement and do away with Made In Canada. Value and capability over optics 

5,  gradually increase the budget in relation to the current/potential threats after establishing a baseline budget (I would like to see us at 1.5%-1.7% AFTER we address the efficiency problem.). If later, 2% is a viable option financially and the current global threat assessment warrants it, then yes.

We need the political will for a better military, not neccesarily money. That starts with the voting population and works its way up to Cabinet.

Unfortunately, the military is not an issue outside of faux veteran abuse outrage and we will probably never see any improvement save for another bigger Afghanistan happening when soldiers start dying again."	FALSE

Feynman understood the difference between what is, and the math that is used to describe it. Not everyone agrees with him sure, but I don't really have anyone else I can trust on matters like this, so I usually defer to his methods. The math is an extremely detailed illustration with (some) predictive power. The fact that it breaks down at large time/space intervals hints at its fundamental limitations.

Also, consider what you're saying when you direct a comment like ""it's a 4th dimension of space-time"" in an ELI5 board. You know full well that an amateur, even a math undergrad like myself, doesn't have a useful understanding of what a manifold, or a dimension actually is.

Lil B has built his fame through crazy use of social media, he is all over twitter, youtube, and myspace back when it was the main social networking site.

Lil B eventually released this diss track,  "" Fuck Kevin Durant""

you think they're wrong and they think you're wrong. So its a moral system that works fine if you're a perfect infallible being, but has fucking horrifying consequences if you ever make a mistake.

If these people live by the code you think is morally right, they are honor bound to hurt as many muslims, mexicans, and liberals as possible because they believe they're all part of a plot to hurt/kill/undermine/genocide white americans, to steal their country and rape their women and blow up their malls. 

Whether you agree that's true or not is irrelevant. No one person has a monopoly on the truth. Each of us only has a limited view of the truth based on our own limitations and biases.

1984	"From what I've read, the patron-client relationship was something generally between the bourgeoise/upper middle/yeoman class, and the aristocracy. The question is asking about poor people. The upper blocks of tenements, the ramshackle houses on the outskirts of the cities; these people would not generally aspire to have access to the formal legal system. There were no police. Score settling was done much more often by family, friends, or not at all. The poor could petition a case, but in practice, it would be exceedingly rare. If they had no patron, it is likely that they would have only the most basic literacy, if any. Here's a quote from SPQR by Mary Beard 

""The sophisticated edifice of Roman law, despite it's extraordinary expertise in formulating legal rules and principles, deciding issues of responsibility and determining rights of ownership and contract, had little impact on the lives of those below the elite and offered little help for their problems. When they tried to use it, the system was sometimes simply overloaded... In general the law was out of reach of most of the polulation, who, as we shall soon see, often looked on trials and legal processes more as a threat to be feared than as a possible protection.""

From my research, it seems like a fantasy to believe that the lower classes generally had access to legal remedies in court.

1993	"*It's Such a Beautiful Day* shows the life of Bill, an awkward 30-something year old man with a mysterious mental condition.  The animation is entirely done on 35 mm film with in camera special effects and final cut for the sound.  The film explores themes of life, time, relationships, and memory with a very absurdist and dark humor filled approach.  Hertzfeldt originally released these as three independent short films before connecting them into one feature-length film.

[Here's the first chapter of the film directly off of Hertzfeldt's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IUX0Qy-IDM)(the posted clip ends at [03:06](https://youtu.be/1IUX0Qy-IDM?t=3m6s))  The film is only about an hour long, and is fantastic.

That is because the human mind evolved to understand patterns. IE cause and effect is something we've witnessed since we were simple mammals.

Perhaps.

Why would I be referring to my past premiums in this context....when I am complaining about my plan getting worse the assumption is its for the upcoming year, the new plan. Last week, I got downgraded from the silver plan to the bronze plan for THIS upcoming year. The silver plan is not minimum coverage so the 13,700 figure for 2016 wasn't relevant to me last year. This year I got downgraded to minimum coverage so new max limit applies to me for 2017, not 2016. 2017. My coverage has gotten worse from last year...it keeps getting worse and more expensive. The proposed maximum has increased (with more expensive premiums) just as it as every year which is a whole different point against ACA. I don't care what the exact increase for the maximum limit is for 2017, its somewhere around 15,000 but that isn't relevant to my point that coverage is getting worse and more expensive. If it weren't for ACA the maximum limit would not matter because I would be able to afford full coverage like I have had my entire life until the minute ACA was passed. The affordable care act is not affordable for the 85% of the country who already had insurance. That's my point. 	FALSE

2070	"I've studied all the religions even worth noting extensively, especially Christianity. All of the other religions become blatant fabrications of man under scrutiny. My life, knowledge, and experiences all directly point to Christ and nothing else. My faith in Christ grows every day.

The Jews prophesied a messiah was coming, right? They had said thousands of years ago a man was going to show up and turn the world on it's head. Well here comes this guy performing miracles claiming to be the Messiah. He's fulfilling prophecies left and right, and he's captured the hearts of the people to the point that even the rulers are afraid of doing away with him. There is no way for a man to gather that much support out of nothing. He must have been doing and saying incredible things to have garnered the love, attention, and belief of so many. The Bible even talks about where the Jewish leaders say, ""We've dealt with false prophets before. They always fade away without the true mandate of God. Let this burn out."" But that didn't happen. Jesus had so much success that it almost seemed as if God was on his side.

Not only this but after Jesus was crucified people claimed to see him rise from the dead. And not just a few people, but hundreds. The people that witnessed the events of Jesus were so convinced of his message and power they were willing to stand up in the face of persecution. A great many people lost their lives because they refused to recant their words. They believed that Jesus was Lord. These people forfeited their lives because they were there. They had seen Jesus perform miracles. They heard his words. They knew the truth, and they could not face their deaths and lie to save their own skins. This must have been a very powerful message indeed.

The message continued to survive persecution even with the power of the world's greatest empire trying to snuff them out. These Christians, these poor middle eastern men and women, were surviving against armies, gold, and might with simply the power of the words of Jesus on their hearts. Ultimately they did survive completely, and the message of Jesus spread like wildfire, changing the world over in a figurative blink of an eye. Not a single person living today has had their life unaffected by the words and actions of this singular poor man from the middle east. This man held the power to change the world, and He claimed to be God."	FALSE

&gt; No, I am not opposed to the idea of non-violent action. It's a perfectly valid and effective tactic to use. Pacifism, especially Gandhi's brand of it, however I do have problems with.

IIRC, Ghandi was also opposed to pacifism, which is why we have the term ""nonviolence"" to begin with -- to distinguish an attempt to change something nonviolently from simple capitulation to power.

Since you don't seem to be a fan of the Civil Rights movement, are there any examples of non violent action that you do approve of?

&gt; Because it usually does; it allows the oppressor to take the energy out of protest and opposition movements without having to do much more than make token, symbolic changes. There is nothing to compel those in power to make changes.

Are there any examples of change that you do not consider to be token change that also did not result in the dissolution of the state, and the attendant violence?

Virginia had to be taken by force, after Charles' beheading and Cromwell's rise to power. A warship was sent to the port of Jamestown, though no shots were fired. ([pp.35-41.](https://books.google.com/books?id=wZS_LGEg7kAC&amp;pg=PA35)) The Virginians surrendered amicably, terms of surrender were handed over for the colonial Assembly to sign, and the governor resigned.

""[Maryland was more disturbed than Virginia by the strife in England, becoming the scene of a fierce struggle for several years.](https://books.google.com/books?id=hnpHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA53)"" Maryland's administration was pro-royal, but its citizenry was less so. Maryland was taken over by pro-Parliament forces in 1643-44, a period known as ""the Plundering Time"" due to rampant lawlessness. Order was restored, though more unrest broke out in 1649, culminating in the overthrow of the local government by ex-governor William Stone in 1655. This led to the Battle of the Severn in 1655, sometimes called the last battle of the English Civil War. Stone was defeated, and sentenced to death. He pled for mercy, which was granted, and he was not executed, though he died a few years later anyway. ([1](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Battle+of+Great+Severn.-a054405265), [2](https://archive.org/details/narrativesofearl01hall), [3](https://archive.org/stream/oldvirginiaandh01fiskgoog#page/n414/mode/2up))

Rhode Island's position was more precarious than that of the other colonies, because they wanted to maintain their separation from the Massachusetts colony and continue offering religious freedom. Roger Williams was afraid they would lose their 1643 royal charter due to the change in leadership in England. Williams was friendly with several members of Parliament, and sailed for England in 1651 to plead his case. After speaking before Parliament and then  talking directly to Oliver Cromwell, he was able to persuade the new government to allow Rhode Island to operate under its previous charter. He returned to Rhode Island in 1654, and Cromwell sent over a letter in 1655 upholding the original royal charter. No further strife with the Cromwell government occurred thereafter, as the Rhode Island citizenry was already rather anti-royal, or more to the point, anti-authoritarian.

First, the essence of science is that it rejects the argument from authority.

Second, it's not scientists or science that causes premature pronouncements based on preliminary research, it's our sensationalistic ""news"" media. Example: the Time magazine cover that announced in bloody letters, ""Ebola is coming.""  News establishments take any study that sounds interesting and ""report"" on only the most sensational aspects, without ever mentioning that the research is tentative. So there's always a cure for cancer right around the corner.

Also, how can the author blame blind acceptance of science for the anti-vaccine idiocy? Not only did science disprove Wakefield's lies, Wakefield himself admitted his research was false. Science is science because it's testable and disprovable, which happens all the time. Remember the announcement that a couple of scientists had measured neutrinos traveling faster than light? Claim debunked, no one now thinks it was valid. The difference? Light speed has no bearing on people's lives, whereas harming children with injections of substances that the parents don't really understand is scary.

And the author's claim that arguably, human beings alone ""have minds, consciousness, self-awareness..."" is patently ridiculous and suggests his argument is based on his own personal religious beliefs, rather than any objective analysis.

It is also import to consider, however, that no matter what a legal institution has as much power as the people of that system give it. I think the biggest point of contention with Trump right now is his travel ban which is in outright opposition to extant legislation. 

The exact allowance of an executive order is nebulous at best. Strictly speaking, it's never a power granted to the president, however George Washington did enact them so it can be assumed there is SOME validity to executive orders. They only apply to departments directly under the executive branch and should have some support from constitution. Actively contradicting a decision by the legislative or judicial branch is clearly outside its purview. 

Thus, the president issuing an executive order that contradicts the constitution should be ignored- it's just a piece of paper with no real meaning. In reality, though, the officers responsible for executing these orders could either be unfamiliar with the constitutional contradiction or actively opposed to the legislation and choose to carry out the action that is effectively treasonous.

The real question here is whether filing an unconstitutional executive order is treasonous. Ultimately it is up to the House of Representatives to determine if that question is worth asking by passing Articles of Impeachment and then up to the Senate to decide."	FALSE

&gt; quantum effects disallow that, even if the neurons themselves are deterministic. Everything would have to be deterministic.

Of course quantum effects disallow determinism. However, neurons are made out of so many molecules that quantum effects are negligible; the chance of e.g. a particular neuron not reaching its treshold potential because of one quantum event is almost zero. The system is not that chaotic; if it were, it would imply that I could for example add neurotransmitter at a synapse and one quantum event in the subsequent signalling pathway could determine whether the neuron fires an action potential. That chance is almost 0, so the macroscopic output is largely deterministic in nature, just like a ball being dropped.

2336	"Teacher here. I've led discussions for groups, classes, and conferences of different sizes, with adults down through about age 12. The best way to manage everyone and make sure that each participant gets something out of the experience is to break down the group size and use a discussion protocol. A protocol is a specific set of rules or a structure that participants have to follow for the discussion. (A *very* complex example would be Robert's Rules of Order, but a protocol could be as simple as the children's game ""Telephone"".) At first, protocols often feel artificial or ""forced"" - unnecessarily cumbersome, like ""why can't you just let us *talk?*"" - but once they get going, they will lead to richer discussion! If your goal is for every participant to reflect on the episode and its connection to deeper questions, then I'll assume that you want to avoid a handful of talkers from dominating the discussion while encouraging deeper thinking.

[Here's a long list of protocols that teachers use.](http://www.schoolreforminitiative.org/protocol-alphabetical-list-2/) For the purpose you described, I'd recommend either [Chalk Talk](http://schoolreforminitiative.org/doc/chalk_talk.pdf), [The Final Word](http://schoolreforminitiative.org/doc/final_word.pdf), or [The Four A's](http://schoolreforminitiative.org/doc/4_a_text.pdf). 

If it were me, I'd use Chalk Talk, and follow the steps below. Chalk Talk is a silent protocol where the conversation happens on paper between four or five students. [Here's an example](http://www.rcsthinkfromthemiddle.com/uploads/2/3/4/1/23418034/6066331_orig.jpg) of a finished Chalk Talk, or see [this video](https://youtu.be/ZqYIFoizPlM?t=82) around 1:22.

**1. In advance.**

Get the materials you need. For Chalk Talk, you'll need one big piece of paper or dry-erase board per group of 5, pens/markers. 

Prep one partner who can briefly model the protocol with you in front of the whole group. This person will need to understand the protocol in advance.

Then you'll need to plan at least one discussion question. It should be open-ended, interesting/provocative, and relevant to the themes you or the conference want to emphasize. Write down the exact wording you want to use. It's okay to use a Yes/No question as long as it can trigger discussion. For example, I once had students read the Bible story about Abraham ""sacrificing"" his son, then we discussed ""Was Abraham a good man? Why or why not?"" 

Finally, figure out how you're going to break the large group down into groups of 4 or 5. You could pre-assign the groups, or have them count off, etc. It doesn't really matter how you do it, just plan something to save time. 

**2. BEFORE you play the episode.**

Model/demonstrate the protocol. Modeling it before you hit play will allow you to proceed straight to discussion once the episode is over, and will also reduce people's anxiety about ""doing it wrong"".

Instead of explaining all the rules/steps, just jump right in to a demonstration and let the audience figure it out. If you have a whiteboard or something, write a silly or unrelated question like ""What makes a party great?"" Then you and your pre-selected partner each take a marker and start writing comments, and responding to each other's comments, and drawing connections, etc. Do it all silently. You might want to play some music. After a couple of minutes, step back and ask an audience member to describe what you did. Then ask ""What are the advantages of having a discussion this way, instead of the whole group doing it aloud?"" Participants might say ""this way, more than one person can 'talk' at a time"" ... ""you can have several different ideas going at once"" ... ""you get a chance to think before you respond"", etc. You might want to write a few bullet-point rules if the audience seems unclear on what to do.

Tell the group they will be doing their own Chalk Talk later in response to the episode you're about to watch. I would not tell the group what the discussion question is going to be, yet.

**3. After you play the episode.**

Move participants into their small groups - I'd say no smaller than 4, no larger than 6 - and distribute materials. At this point, you should reveal your discussion question and post it where everyone can see. Ask one member of each group to copy the question onto the center of their paper. Then, turn on the music and announce ""No speaking for the next __ minutes! This is Chalk Talk!""

While groups are writing, you should circulate with your own marker. Feel free to jump in with a challenging question or something to prod a group's discussion. After an appropriate amount of time has passed, announce that there's 20 seconds left and everyone should finish writing their last thought.

**4. Wrapping up.**

At the end, you have a few options, as described on the PDF. You could invite groups to rotate and view another group's discussion, or ask each group to share out the main idea they agreed (or disagreed) on, or some sort of whole-group activity. You might also point out some trends or disparities you noticed among all the groups.

**Why the anthem?**

One reason...the anthem is a time when the cameras are on the players, but the players aren't in the middle of playing the game.

Another...it's symbolic. The national anthem represents the country it belongs to. Standing for it is a sign of respect to that country, and by abstaining it is showing that he cannot respect a country that doesn't treat it's citizens equally.

**How does that help?**

As others have mentioned...many of a certain background/mindset like yourself may not have even considered the topic deeply unless someone brought attention to it.

Also, controversy gets attention from the click driven media, and also taps into basic human nature: if we all agree, we may briefly talk about something but then we move on. If there are disagreements, we are social creatures that come together and discuss the disagreement to come to a resolution, peaceful or otherwise.

**To your comment, not the question...** my personal interpretation is that the anthem is not played to show respect to military. It's played in homage of our country. The military has served in wars over the years to protect our country, and many rights we have today stem from conflicts that required armed conflict, but as someone else said we are not our military. You can be upset at how the government, police forces, or any other group in the country operate without necessarily disrespecting the troops.

2394	From what I've seen on the last years nexus devices QC 3.0 was faster. But that's comparing 15W vs 18W QC 3.0. The Pixels have USB-PD at 18W which is equivalent to QC 3.0 power. QC is probably slightly quicker but not more than a few minutes. We won't really know until people report how long it takes to charge the Pixels. And if you're going to compare the charge times of phones on PD vs QC you need to compare phones with the same/similar sized batteries. Battery longevity doesn't really come into play here. Faster degradation doesn't come into effect in Li-ion batteries until charging at greater than ~3C(For Pixel XL with 3.45 A/hr battery 3C would be ~10A or 42W but limited to 18W by charging circuitry.) So 18W in either case is at just over 1.3C for the Pixel Xl and 1.7C for the reg Pixel and won't affect battery degradation.  All charging has about the same safety so that really isn't a factor.

Comparing candidates strictly on their campaign fundraising, you will find yourself in trouble.

In 2008, Obama raised $730,000,000 and McCain raised $368,000,000.  So, Obama is unfit for any job?

We can go on, but you should get the point by now.  Fundraising does not equal winning and has no bearing at all on qualification.

You have a job. It's stable, gives you some pay. You found out the solution to your sleep issues, and now your entire life has changed. You can explore different interests, you can find new hobbies, you can live. Don't strangle yourself with mountains of college loans/debt to do some ""soul searching."" Since you're behind in this game, you gotta do some research first.

What's your passion, your dream job? Becoming a doctor? Have you shadowed doctors first, have you looked into which specialty you would like, have you explored other routes and possibilities first before deciding on becoming a doctor?

When most people enter college, it's because they're pushed into it when they're not ready. Now that you're able to study, you feel 'pushed' into it too. But you don't need to feel that way; you're already living and making money.

Before you enroll in a college, I would suggest you get two things in order first. First is your passion. Second is your finance. Know what you want to do, how to get there, and then find the shortest way there. I'd suggest community college and then transferring to another school to complete a degree. Do your research first though about what credits can transfer; this will help cut down on costs.

It's currently impossible to transfer an early-stage fetus to another womb or some sort of machine. A five-year old child can more easily be transferred to another family and survive, perhaps even thrive. So while their lives may be equal in value in some cosmic or religious sense, it doesn't mean that the law should treat me equally.

Now, let me perhaps preempt you by pointing out that many laws are not at all consistent, and I don't mean to suggest that they are. What I'm saying is that where there exists a practical difference, the law may use it to draw a line. In many cases we are talking about contradictory concerns, so we cope by drawing imperfect lines between behavior we really cannot condone and the rights of an individual.

Imagine, therefore, a world where a medical machine can sustain a fetus until ""birth"". Perhaps that would move the center of opinions towards anti-abortion.

At first, the conquest of Poland allowed direct material and science exchanges through the trans-Siberian railway, but these were very few and would have resulted in little, if anything, due to shortages on both sides.


After the closing of the railway due to Operation Barbarossa (and the clear failure of the Germans to open up trade links through the Suez in Africa), the only contact the Japanese and Germans could ascertain was through submarines. Numerous designs, especially torpedoes and submarine detection systems like Metox, were exchanged in places like Lorient in France or the Indian Ocean. The Japanese sent the most submarines to Europe, however close to the end of the war it was Germany sending U-Boats to Japan. The last such mission (U-234) never finished as it surrendered due to the closing of hostilities in Europe. It was carrying uranium oxide and plans on how to create heavy water, vital for the production of nuclear weaponry.


In terms of combat assistance, there was very little and mostly relegated to the naval side of things. German auxiliary ships *Micahel* and *Thor* went around the Cape of Good Hope, as did a few German U-Boats. The U-Boats were relegated to the Indian Ocean along with a few Italian subs, but the cruisers fought throughout the Pacific and were supplied from Japanese ports. All prizes were given to the Japanese due to inability to send them to Europe.


Put simply, it was not in any way an alliance that could hold it's water. Sheer reality stomped on any hope that the Germans and Japanese had for a practical alliance, and the scientific and material exchanges between them were to few to add anything to either's war effort. No long-term planning or real coordination of military operations of both powers ever happened.


As you put it, it was a de-facto NAP. They did draw up plans for post-war spheres of influence, but these were never concrete and both states considered the other the enemy of the future. Think of the Allies and the USSR, but with lend lease only occurring once every 3 months."	FALSE

2876	"Wife was looking at Foresters recently. It looks like the 2017s do have some new features and a facelift, but the current body style was introduced in 2014. You can buy used for $20K or less (I know this because I kept a spreadsheet). Don't fall for the dealer's tricks and get too focused on the 0% rate; $30K at 0% still costs $9K more than $20K at 2.5%. 

To address the downsides, yes the used car will have miles on it, but anything under 60K on a well-maintained Subaru is essentially the same (according to my mechanic friend). You could also go CPO if you want the additional peace of mind from the warranty. They fixed the oil issue under a recall, and other than that, these are reliable vehicles. There is some risk with buying used, but it's minimal in this case (these cars are 3 years old max).

So really your question comes down to, ""Are the new features in the 2017 model worth $9K?"" To me, I just don't think it's worth it to spend ~50% more, but you will have to answer that yourself.

PS Which trim are you looking at? When I went to the dealer, they quoted $1,700 to add leather. So you can consider Premiums and adding leather for much less than Limited/Tourings. We did this in the car we ended up buying (CX-5) and our friend commented that it smelled like a new car, even though it was a couple years old. Nice little unintentional bonus!

PPS Have you checked out the CX-5 AWD? Better safety rating, trunk space, and ride (IMO). And this coming from someone who owns and loves his Outback...

You're somewhere in between, it's better to think about what you've enjoyed in the books rather than whether you've reached complete understanding.

Another approach is to think of a modern work that you enjoy, and what annotations it would need in the future once the cultural references are out of date and forgotten.

To create despair, punish pro rebel civilians, and if the civilians flee then no big loss for Assad. Russian military advisers have been with Assad from the start so they have to have at least partial, at a minimum,  influence on this tactical decision.

You're right about Putin agreeing to ceasefire and wanting to hold Assad back compared to Iran. Now Putin is joined at the hip and he has to own Assads(and Iran) decisions. They are allies. Putin negotiating with Washington is a diplomatic and visible achievement in geopolitical stature. So the two sides negotiate to get what they want. Americans want the attack on Aleppo stopped, Russia won't allow it. Both have good reasons for their respective sides. 

But in the sphere of actual fighting, he has proven he doesn't give a shit about civilians. Aleppo today looks a lot like Chechnya when the Russians got done with it each time they fought there.

Her position held her to an even higher degree of accountability. Whether she ""intended"" to do it is completely irrelevant. 

When she did the training and signed the forms that excuse was no longer an excuse. The fact the FBI Director, who has since been proven to have established ties to the Clinton Foundation in his past and still didn't recuse himself, went the extra mile to add new language ""intent"", to the federal statute which the FBI as a non legislative branch of government absolutely does not have the right to do, is further proof the executive branch under Obama has completely covered her crimes.

Congress only has the right to create the laws, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt that those laws had been thwarted.

The executive branch (Obama, FBI, AG Loretta Lynch) are the only branch that can impose the penalties (prosecution, arrest). Furthermore,  under this particular statute conviction here disqualifies her from running as president, more reason the executive branch covered her crime as their parties presidential candidate.

3004	"I think one needs to have a clear picture of the hypothetical copying process before one can understand what constraints it poses on the solution.

Many people think that we should e.g. replicate the entire brain chemistry and simulate all the neurons in a computer environment. This means that we'd build a digital clone of each neuron and all its connections. A major part of your brain -- in fact, most of it -- receives sensory information. All those nerve endings on your body do have to meet a neuron somewhere in your head in order for senses to work, after all.

It follows that a digital neuronal copy of brain would require digital copy of a body too, just to maintain the normalcy of experience.

However, as a counterpoint, consider people that are severely paralyzed due to spinal cord damage. We can assume that they e.g. can't feel or control anything from the neck down, for purposes of this discussion. These people ostensibly have no communication with the rest of their body, yet this doesn't mean that their brains no longer work, or that they aren't conscious. However, a brain completely divorced from all the senses would have no sight, hearing, or even sensations from the head region, so it would be a rather ugly existence to contemplate.

An additional complexity comes from neural adaptation. We know that all neurons continuously adapt to their current level of stimulation so that they fire at roughly the same average rate over time. If we have no simulated body, then all those neurons that used to receive sensory data begin to go hypersensitive, to the point of firing to random (simulated) thermal noise. There might be similar adaptation to pain reception -- complete lack of any signaling from any pain receptor might cause a kind of ache from every pain sensing neuron from your entire being.

This is a misunderstanding.  There *is* a problem with the headphone jack: it makes the phone not waterproof *and* takes up a ton of space.  There's a sense that Apple is trying to drive the market away from headphone jacks in general, and I agree that it's a cynical move that's bad for consumers (just like removing the floppy drive was from the iMac), but there really is a reason there.

That said, what Apple did with the Air was a nice idea: they didn't remove the CD drive from their main laptops, just this special, cool one, so if you wanted to keep your drive you could just *not get* a MacBook Air.  I don't actually use iPhones so I don't care particularly about this (when they get rid of headphone jacks on their laptops I'll be fucking pissed, though), but if they actually wanted to not fuck over the consumer, they probably could while still designing their flagship phone without the jack: they could have an iPhone7J or whatever that isn't waterproof, is bigger, and has the jack.

You seem to think that headlines in the media, especially media outlets that for decades have had biases to certain viewpoints, reflect what the entire country is feeling. Remember that Trump had a massive number of votes, and that many around the world and in the US support him. He doesn't have a 0% approval rating, and there's not war in the streets. Many people who are shocked or despaired by his actions don't realize that an equal number of people are impressed and proud of his actions. The country isn't close to breaking down and going into rebellion because not everyone views him Presidency as a bad thing. Not everyone is unhappy or angry, just like not everyone is happy and supportive. You have a right to believe what you want and follow the political ideas you want to follow, and that right is as strong as ever, and it won't be ending anytime soon.

Why would LF do all this? Because only Cersei is expecting the Vale to possibly move on WF. When news gets out (if it happens, of course), Olenna would realize LF's game, but (if LF times this right) it'll be too late for the Tyrells.

3314	i think i'm understanding you, i may be a bit bitter too so sorry if we but heads. In my life, most guys around my age (21) are looking for a relationship with no expiry date with one woman, so am i. most girls we date or run into want say stuff like i want to date around, and such. not just party sluts but nice and average girls, and when they break up it only takes 1 week to find another guy. if you had options and we're shallow why not date around right? So maybe its an age thing but i'm finding it super hard to find woman like myself, wants commitment, works out, studies and has interest in wide range of topics, has hobbies, open minded and ability to accept one self is wrong. and this is common with gentlemen born after 1994, where as guys who get girls don't need to commit and can date around, leaving many woman wondering why men don't commit.

Adding another $2500 to the computation above (to do it for 37.5K instead of 35K) means your federal tax is $25 + $250, or $275. I don't know how much federal withholding you've already had this year (check your last paycheck from before summer break). If you've paid more than $275 federal tax you don't need any more withholding.

IRS Pub 15 has charts you can use to look up your filing status, paycheck frequency, and paycheck size. You can read about how much is taken based on number of allowances you select. That can help you see if ""5"" makes sense for remainder of this year.

From the fact that you said no withholding happened, it would seem ""5"" is okay, as long as you have already paid at least $275 in federal withholding. And even if your withholding hasn't reached $275, that is not a huge amount to have to pay in April and there is no underpayment penalty if your tax minus withholding plus credits is less than $1000.

3330	"That's a very interesting question, but also difficult to answer. Could you clarify what you mean by ""at a statistical level""? If you mean how highly each factor correlates with violent crime later in life, I am unaware of any such research. But if someone does know of similar research, I would love to see it.

My gut instinct, though, is that it would not be a very useful measure. There are two reasons for this that I can think of off the top of my head. The first is that each violent crime is unique. The factors that lead to a drive-by shooting are not the same (or perhaps more accurately, not weighted the same) as the factors that lead to mass shootings like Orlando. I know this is kind of bypassing your question and going back to the individual level, but it is quite tough to avoid. 

The second is that conducting statistical analysis on this topic would be incredibly difficult. It would rely on self-report data from the criminals themselves (and close friends and family who are inherently biased and may not know what to look for). Further, operationalizing these variables into anything other than nominal and ordinal data would be one hell of a trick. It's possible, theoretically, but as a statistician it makes me cringe. This would limit analysis to relatively simple techniques like frequency charts, rank-order correlations, and ordinal regression if you're lucky. This is all a little technical and I hope I didn't give a few people horrible flashbacks to stats in college, but it is important to understand the limitations facing social science research like this.

Please stop freaking out for the sake of your sister and mother. There is no ""magic wand"" that will give you 25L. You have to wage multiple battles at the same time, like:

* Check your father's insurance, PF, bank accounts, etc
* Pledge jewellery/home/other property and take a personal loan
* Significantly slash all recurring expenses - Phone bills, cosmetics, electricity, cable, etc
* Sell your vehicle and use public transport (get a student pass for both you and your sister). Fuel is another big monthly expense. Also sell old furniture, AC, TV, etc.
* Take up a part-time job like driving ola cab, etc
* Reduce spending, buy grocery in bulk, get stuff from ration, in weekends visit religious places for solace and food, etc
* Contact the college for educational loan
* There's just so much more you can do

Don't depend on a one-trick pony. You need to run A COUPLE of threads at the same time. gofundme is more like a top-up, just one of multiple threads. When one loan runs out, you must have another lined up, and to do that you must have started all these much earlier.

In reply to Dbolical on [""DETROIT HOOD AT NIGHT.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4yfd45):

&gt; Edit: Okay I'm done responding to people calling this fake now. I'm going back to r/pokemongotrade. If you want an interesting read, take a look at the rest of my comment about some crazy shit Alabama has. There's links and such for the skeptics.
&gt; _________________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone in this thread is from Alabama, they may be able to vouch for me, but
&gt; 
&gt; There are some areas in Alabama, and I'm talking super rural areas, that are just like the Detroit ghettos but worse. I know of a town in Alabama called ""The Hill"" by the locals. It's 100% run by the bloods. It's so dangerous. So dangerous that 2 summers ago the CIA, FBI and DEA launched a full scale 3 day invasion of the town, arrested tons of people and busted drug houses. The town is the central distribution point of Cocain for the south. It came up from Florida and went to this town in Alabama. Crazy shit. 
&gt; 
&gt; I lived in that town for a few years for reasons and I hated it. I was in some sticky situations. I drove up to a store they call ""the stop and stab"" and saw a guy who had broken out of jail a few months beforehand. Needless to say I left.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a town called Union Town. FUUUCK that town. The police are run by the gangs and they have this event called [""The foot wash""](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/on_the_ground_at_footwash_2015.html). It's like a carnival, but only has drugs, hookers and more drugs and hookers. Cops go too. It's all fucked. People think this stuff doesn't exist in the 21st century, but it does.
&gt; ________________________________________________________
&gt; Edit: the town is Marion for those saying the town doesn't exist. Also, for those calling B.S on this, *go to the town yourself*, then you'll be stuttering over your words. [Here is a link](http://www.wsfa.com/story/25811953/40-arrested-in-selma-marion-on-gun-and-drug-charges) provided to me by another Redditor.
&gt; 
&gt; Edit 2: I'm aware CIA doesn't operate within the U.S unless working with other government agencies or foreign agencies. As this was a big bust, I assume the trail they were following lead them to the origin of the drugs which was most definitely not the U.S as it came up from Florida to Alabama. Additionally, I'm not here to ""prove"" anything. Simply drive through Union City, Alabama yourself and take a look. Just a tip though. Don't stop at red lights.

3410	"I agree with your, points but your original argument is that stereotypes should be embraced. We will all stereotype whether we want to or not and we absolutely should acknowledge that. Making a judgement call and using it to get to know someone better isn't a bad thing. However stereotyping as a tool to evaluate who a person is or using it as a substitution for social intimacy is where I and many other people have a problem with it. 

Stereotyping as a way to build a connection is entirely different from stereotyping in place of a connection. On it's own, the stereotype of ""This guy likes Sandman so he must like comic books"" isn't helpful or harmful. If you decide to use this judgement to build a connection with that person then it's helpful because rather than relying on the stereotype as a judgement, you are relying on the stereotype as a hypothesis that you are actively reevaluating. If you were to use that stereotype and say he's a nerd and probably socially awkward and weird then you are relying on the stereotype to make a judgement and the result is harmful.

It's inevitable that we will put people into boxes, but we should put effort into taking that person out of the box we constructed. If you make decisions such as who to hire or who to invite to the party based on stereotypes you're going to hurt a lot of people. If you move beyond the stereotype and use your judgements to build a connection, your actions can probably help a lot of people. "	FALSE

3451	"I think this is getting into different territory than simply culture-borrowing, but I'll try to address your points.

I'm not arguing for that kind of society. Where did I state that? None of this is about force or suppression. I'm not sure where you're reading that.
You have a right to express yourself. Others have a right to be irritated by it, call you out on it, or, ideally, try to teach you about the culture you chose to borrow from. 

I don't agree with people being segregationist about culture-borrowing. I'm saying ""it would be nice"" if people would consider the context of where things originated when they choose to express themselves. I don't think they're a bad person for not doing so, and I didn't mean to insinuate it, I apologize if I did. I just mean, to the people who arise from that culture where whatever thing was borrowed, it may be offensive, and they have a right to criticize you as much as you have a right to express yourself. That is them, expressing themselves. 

If you want to express yourself without their criticism, imagine for a moment that perhaps the reason they're criticizing *you* is because they weren't allowed to express themselves, their own culture, their natural features without criticism, and are lashing out as a result. Is it fair? No. But understand.  

It would be ridiculous for us in everything we do to be cognizant of whom we might be stepping on, I get that. My asking someone to take ""struggles"" of a minority group into consideration may be too much for most people. But do you really think having context for something you borrow from another culture is a bad thing? The context alone may help lift that culture up. I don't think you need to be heading to rallies and protests and reading social justice blogs to just understand where you're taking something from and share it. Don't claim it for your own. Let others in the mainstream know, if they ask, where it came from. I don't think that's a difficult request in the slightest. Think of it as listening to music -- another way to express yourself. If someone likes a song they hear you listening to, would it be particularly hard, or damaging to your freedom of expression, to tell them the album or band?  

People have been victimized. Ignoring that doesn't make them feel better. Ignoring it doesn't make them ignore it. It doesn't make their children ignore it. Hell, so much already has been ignored, and now those victimized groups have the opportunity to speak out about it. Black people didn't have the opportunity to express themselves by wearing their hair naturally. Some still don't in professional settings. I'm not sure where I said parents should tell their children they're going to be a victim. My parents didn't. I still experienced discrimination. I think there are many great things about the US, but racism is still alive and well, even if it's ""harmless"" racial insensitivity like, ""You shouldn't wear your hair like that"". The point is not to tell minority groups they're victimized. The point is to tell the majority group that minority groups are victimized in the hope that they, with their privilege, can help. Understanding privilege didn't make me, someone who's black, a girl, mentally ill, and LGBT, say, ""Whelp. Guess I'm gonna fail. Better not try."" I achieved because I wanted to achieve. If someone doesn't, they were lazy in the first place.

For some anecdotes:
 My sister, when she was four (and she's 24 now), was not allowed to play with the other (white) girls at a sleepover. They told her she was a servant and had to bring them food and drinks. She didn't understand and went along with it, but luckily my mom hadn't left yet, realized what was happening, and took her home. Do you think it would have been healthier for my mother to explain the actuality of what had happened, that racism exists, or not? I knew privilege was a thing when I was a child and I saw very few people on TV, in movies, in video games, in advertisements that looked like me, or people who looked like me that were considered beautiful. I wasn't aware of what it was, but I knew of it. I know it's still a thing when a little black girl I babysat at a domestic violence shelter a couple of years ago freaked out when a few white girls came to volunteer with me and spent the entire time touching their hair and crying about how she wished hers was the same. I discovered discrimination when I faced discrimination, as did my sisters, and I'm sure it's the same for many. My parents didn't sit me down as soon as I understood words and say, ""CornflowerIsland, you won't succeed because other people have privilege"". I'm not sure where that is happening, exactly. If it is, bad parents. But I don't think this is happening often at all.

We can't sit here and ignore issues. Discrimination does happen. You are not a bad person for expressing yourself with borrowed cultural aspects and not sharing their origins or context with those in the mainstream, but you're, at least to me, a more understanding, compassionate person if you do.

3498	"Squirting is incredibly fun and sexy. And, in my experience, it hasn't always happened strictly from g-spot stimulation. In fact, most of the times I've done it have been from just rubbing myself or my partner going down on me. The g-spot is great too, though! My current partner is a pro at making me squirt, but before him I'd only been able to do it to myself, without any sort of internal stimulus.

It's something that you should figure out how to do on your own before a partner can make it happen. If you know when it's about to happen and what it feels like and what you need to make it happen, it'll be much easier to do with someone else. 

Something I've noticed is that it's easier to squirt if I've already had an orgasm. For me, if I wait a few minutes after my first orgasm and then start rubbing myself again, I'm not as sensitive as I was initially, and the pleasure is deeper. You can sort of feel everything building up and like you need some sort of release. When you feel you're about to orgasm again, stop rubbing and try to push as hard as you can. (The bath towel is indeed a very good idea, as mentioned above.) For me, this is when it happens. It doesn't shoot across the room or anything, but it's pretty incredible and definitely substantial. I can usually repeat that process several times before having a big ""finishing"" orgasm.

I hope this helps! I made a throwaway account because this is such a private thing that I never get to share, but have always wanted to discuss it. I'll also note that I don't squirt every time I masturbate or have sex, but when I do it's always a lovely surprise. :)"	FALSE

I love this argument style that's been invented recently.

'Germans need to be ever vigilant against the resurgence of Nazism'

I hope you're not suggesting that **all** Germans were Nazis, that's a horribly Germanphobic statement to make. We shouldn't give in to fear and label all 1.6 billion past and future Germans with the same brush as a small minority.

What a useful response this all is.

We could be talking about how more than half of British Muslims wouldn't report an impending terrorist attack. Or we could just shout over and over that not **every single Muslim** thinks that.

That's useful, not **all**. Just either enough of a proportion to effectively not matter, or enough of a minority openly admitting horrible things, or an active small minority actually carrying out despicable acts.

But not **all**. Never **all*.

What I don't understand is why it's just Muslims that this very useful **all** logic comes up with. Why are murderers allowed to be vilified in the press when not **all** murderers are mass murderers. Mass murder is a lot worse. And not **all** drunk drivers are also pedophiles, are we claiming that pedophilia isn't more important?

Also why are Muslims the only population being given credit for having **some** members who act in good faith towards the places they live?

1.) this is changing. Many developing countries are attempting to skip over heavy carbon producing energy methods in favor of renewables. http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2015/05/power-shifts

In many cases, renewables make more sense for developing countries, because they require less infrastructure. One giant coal plant needs to be wired to everywhere in the country, whereas you can put up a wind turbine in every village, and just wire things up locally. 

2.) Developing countries account for a TINY fraction of total carbon output. China accounts for 30% of worldwide carbon output. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions They're attempting to reduce this, but simply by virtue of population and their dominant role in global trade, this may be difficult. The real contributor (in terms of per capita contributions) to global carbon output is the United States. Despite having a population a quarter the size of China, we still produce 15% of the world's carbon. That means US citizens produce twice as much carbon per capita than Chinese citizens, and more than 3 times as much as the world average. "	FALSE

3636	"&gt; Nobody is holding anyone at gunpoint. You're charactizing regulation as if it's a shakedown.

Sure they are. If I own a business and refuse to comply to the regulations set by the State, then what? Well, generally I'd get some sort of fine. If i refuse to pay the fine, at some point it is escalated to the point that armed men with guns will come to my house. If I refuse them entry into my home, they will break down my door, hold me at gunpoint while they either 1) Throw me in jail, 2) Take my property or 3) Both (the most likely scenerio).

In any case, all of the State's actions for a business owner refusing to comply with regulations is by threat of force. Even in cases where regulations are essentially protecting no one, this is still the outcome of refusal.

What basic right gives another human the permission to imprison or use force against someone just because they aren't following the rules? If the government has all powers delegated by the citizens (as it is said to), surely there must be some basic right that can be delegated to suit that purpose.

&gt; in a regulated market nothing is stopping a business from not entering into an industry that is regulated in a way they don't agree with.

What kind of thinking is it that you would rather have less consumer choices than more?

Again, what human right allows you to restrict someone's ability to trade freely? If I have a good that someone else wants, why do I first need to ask permission from the State and then (most likely) pay extra costs incurred by these regulations. The same regulations getting kid's lemonade stands shut down because they don't have the correct licensing.

Regulations, by raising the barrier of entry into the marketplace, only keep out the people who need economic mobility the most. It also is a very useful way for current business owners to crush competition and thus institute a harmful monopoly. Business owners work with lobbyists and politicians to build laws exclusively targeting people who may try to undercut them with a better service. The people in poor areas who simply want to open a basic business and start making money for themselves, must now also keep in mind any regulations or licenses that the State requires them to pay for. Why do you want to make it harder for underprivileged and poverty-stricken individuals to make money for themselves?

To reiterate, being for regulations means you think it is okay that poor people have less chances to become successful entrepreneurs.

&gt; Regulations like rural electricity make life better for the entire country.

How so? For example, how does it make life better for the person who is footing that cost and losing money because at that time it was not profitable? 

No one should be forced to operate their business at a loss just to accommodate those people. That is just a dressed up form of slavery (can expand on this if you would like).

&gt;That sounds pretty moral to me.

Again, forcing a business owner (again; at the barrel of a gun or by threat of force) to operate their operations at a loss just to accommodate someone who will not make them money is not a moral solution. Illegitimate aggression (read: not self defense) is never a moral solution. 

&gt;If you don't want to be forced to contribute to the country then you don't have to start an electricity company. Nobody is being forced to do anything.

""If you dont want to be forced to....nobody is forced to do anything""....uhhh?

Starting a business is no one's concern except the business owner and those he chooses to do business with (as long as it isn't violating anyone else's rights). You don't get to decide when someone can make transactions with their neighbors. To state otherwise is a pretty totalitarian viewpoint.

&gt; Regulations outline how you have to do something if you choose to do it

What does it matter if I am not violating anyone else's right to own property, speak freely, or otherwise live? Why can't such regulations be voluntary?  Not being sold a specific product or service is not a violation of rights, no matter how you want to twist things.

.  
The issues comes down to two things:  
1- They dont earn their money under the same conditions. With corruption, terrible health and pollution laws, and cheap wages, a Chinese businessman can make millions dumping waste into sewers.  
.  
Where as in Canada, the same business practices would be illegal, you can't possible earn the same money as your costs are different when you have to do things right.  
.  
But they of course dont want to live in the shithole they create, so they take their money and move to where its better, Canada!  
.  
2- They pay little to no taxes, and being new to the country, have contributed nothing to the local infrastructure, but use all its benefits.  
.  
This gets even worse when you think about how much a Canadian would have to earn before taxes to match the dirty Chinese money.  
.  
If the Chinese want to buy houses, thats fine, but the market should be fair. When they can earn money with complete disregard for health or safety codes, and then take their dirty money and buy where you can't run a company like that, its unfair.  
.  
.  
And NO! we shouldn't lower our standards for health and safety. We should force them to raise theirs by stopping their ability to up and move from the messed up environments they create.

3707	"&gt; I have two issues with this view.

In anticipation of your issues, I chose my words carefully. ""note that a **late-term** fetus doesn't just randomly appear inside a womb""

The progression goes like this: sex -&gt; blastocyst -&gt; embryo -&gt; fetus -&gt; late-term fetus -&gt; infant

Since OP is making the ""person"" argument, we need to ask when there's enough of a brain to possibly be a person. In my personal opinion (given that I'm pro-abortion, not just pro-choice) I think that one becomes a person some time after birth. But if you want to push the line back as far as possible, you absolutely cannot push it back further than a fetus.

See where I'm going with this?

&gt; 1) There is not always consent to sex.

Irrelevant. After sex, whether there was consent or not, there are still choices that do not touch on OP's position. Emergency contraception (morning-after pill) is not affecting a person. Early-term abortion isn't either.

So getting back to my point, whether there was consent to sex or not, allowing the blastocyst to implant, and allowing an embryo to develop **is** consent to the creation of a person.

&gt; 2) Consent to sex is not consent to have a child.

3764	"&gt; You are committing a category error when you say things like ""your worldview can't account for logic"", because logic is one of my presuppositions I don't need to account for it, i don't need ""preconditions"" for my presuppositions.

Your worldview is a collection of all of your presuppositions. It is how you interpret the world around you. So, in your case, you have presuppositions that are in conflict. You presuppose logic, but your other presuppositions necessarily lead to the conclusion that there is no logic (or at least you cannot know logic). Your humanistic worldview says that all your thoughts are just biochemical reactions. These reactions cannot produce knowledge of reality. They cannot produce knowledge of logic or absolute truth. These biochemical reactions give you no reason to think that you can know anything.

&gt;are nonsensical. If logic is one of my presuppositions, I don't need to account for it.

But, because it is in conflict with your other presuppositions, either your presupposition regarding logic is false or your humanistic worldview is false. They cannot both be true.

&gt;You also misunderstand the concept of absolute truth, and seem to think that my view of truth must conform to your worldview's. That is of course not the case, as your worldview is not shown to be true. So why do I need to conform to it?

I understand the concept of absolute truth. I also understand that you live your life in a way that demonstrates that you believe absolute truth exists.

&gt;Plus, you have not demonstrated absolute truth, so as I discussed in my previous post, I will dismiss any appeals to absolute truth until you do so.

Why do I need to demonstrate absolute truth when you demonstrate it every day in the way you live your life. I have already given you examples of how you demonstrate absolute truth, and you have not denied them. You demonstrate your belief in absolute truth when you balance your checkbook; when you look at your paycheck; when you drive your car; when you have a conversation (you expect the words you use to have certain meanings and that they need to be used in a particular structure in order for anyone to understand you); when you make an argument.

The point is not whether or not I can prove absolute truth exists. We all demonstrate that we belief absolute truth exists by the way we live our lives. The point is, you have a worldview that is in conflict with the belief that absolute truth exists. You live inconsistently with your worldview. You know that your worldview cannot account for logic, and yet you know that logic exists. So, you attempt to add logic as one of your presuppositions without taking in account that your worldview has no room for it. Rather than changing your worldview to account for logic, you try to slap logic onto your worldview, but it won't stick. You demonstrate that by not being able to answer how biochemical reactions can account for you knowing anything."	FALSE

Well stated, give the opponent a turn to answer it, and when it hits face on curve, it just gives you a random 6 mana minion at turn 5.  This is a great balanced idea that can be very strong (you get Sylvanas, for example) but not broken or impossible to deal with.

3798	"AH, not someone on the Red team, someone who is on the Blue Team, who has a Red Team alt will weaken the Red gyms so that the Blues can take it out.

I used to play Ingress where there were ppl who would do a similar (but more difficult) thing. There are some Portals which would end up being more important than the rest because of their central location between 2 other portals really far away or the would be a hub for one reason or the other. You would need lots of Rare Shields to help protect the Portal from being taken down. There are these items called the ADA and Jarvis Virus which would reverse the Ownership of a Portal (what was Enlightened is now Resistance). So, I was Enlightened so I'll explain from that point of view. The Resistance would take control of an Enlightened Hub in an overnight raid and then create a very weak one (no shields, you can only place 4 Portal Mods, they would select non-shield ones like Link Amps) and then use a Jarvis Virus to turn it from Resistance to Enlightened. The next day we would see the crap Enlightened Portal and we couldn't use it as a Hub since it would be immediately taken down, so we would wait for it to decay leaving an outstanding instruction that no one should recharge the portal in the intention that once it decayed we could recapture it and place 4 strong shield mods. But there was a player (Resistance Main, Enlightened alt) who would constantly recharge it whenever it looked like it was about to decay completely ruining that location for us. So, the Resistance couldn't hold it if they captured and the Enlightened couldn't use it. A very clever tact that we ended up using too. I'll just mention that I was a player during the early runs of Ingress so this may not be possible anymore, so don't call me out on that :p

My point though was that Ingress was this really cult game with a  smaller following and still people would go to absurd lengths to try and abuse the system using alts. So, in Pokemon Go (larger player base) with a MUCH simpler way to weaken opposing teams, measures should be taken against potential abuse."	FALSE

We again either choose not to or ignore. We are capable of love, hate, truth, lies, murder, rape, compassion, empathy, joy, laughter, anger, greed, etc... we are all capable. We choose. This book opens the door of choice and then leads you through it. You just have to choose. If you believe you can't, you are right. If you believe there is another way, you are right, if you believe reading the book will assist, you are right. That is the cool thing about choice. It's all in your head. ;) no seriously. It is.

I can keep going if you don't understand yet.

&gt; And yet it is, as even when its not forced its seen as bad because one isn't showing their emotions and that being feminine which feminists want men to be.

Because it frequently is forced. Men are socially engineered to suppress their emotions, this leads to violent outbursts, which are not good for anyone. Men who are taught how to handle their emotions from a young age are the ones who are the ones less prone to violence. This would not affect a true stoic.

That article was a terrible example, if you actually read it. It was talking about mass killers and why so many are white and male.

Nope, blaming toxic masculinity, not masculinity. 

We use a different term (toxic masculinity) because it's has a better definition that actually fits what the core issue is better than misandry does. And yeah, you will find many feminists don't really believe misandry is an issue in the US, largely due to a complete misunderstanding of Critical Race Theory (which is wrongly condensed to power+prejudice=racism) applied to sexism, but also because many of the misandrious issues we face here root back to anti-femininity, eg all those things I listed before. Now, you can argue if it's anti-femininity or not, but at that point it's semantics. "	FALSE

But your claim was ultimately that the only way to find an answer was to weigh the credibility of the aggregate evidence. You spoke of the more intelligent analysis but didn't explain how it works.

The central basis for your argument was that there are no significant forms of discrimination against men, so I supplied them.

Now to convince me of your argument you would have to demonstrate the following.

Intelligent analysis demonstrating that discrimination against women is more widespread and impactful. 

To help you do that I will give you my more detailed theory on why this is so hard to quantify for me. 

Women, generally fall in the middle of the spectrum in terms of power. They often have less power than the CEO's and heads of states that tend to be men. But tend to be better off than the homeless, and imprisoned that tend to be men.

I already accept that women are less represented, and discriminated against at the top of society, to specifically change my mind you would have to convince me that they are discriminated against and well represented among the bottom compared to men.

 * [The president met with BLM](http://hellobeautiful.com/2016/02/18/president-obama-black-lives-matter-black-history-month/).
 * Overall, BLM events are met with acceptance by the majority, for example, [in Portland people agreed to raise their hands in support when asked](http://www.infowars.com/black-lives-matter-protesters-target-white-diners-eating-brunch/).

In other words, while a ""protest movement"", it's actually pretty mainstream. The president supports them! Compare that to the failed Occupy movement (ignored), or the 60's civil rights movement (often met with violent opposition).

Now, part of that might be that they set their goals low (we all want black lives to matter just as much as others; we all don't want cops to target black men). But while most of their protests are of dubious benefit, they also have had some clear impact, as [Obama recently mentioned](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/07/remarks-president-howard-university-commencement-ceremony):

&gt; Brittany Packnett, a member of the Black Lives Matter movement and Campaign Zero, one of the Ferguson protest organizers, she joined our Task Force on 21st Century Policing.  Some of her fellow activists questioned whether she should participate.  She rolled up her sleeves and sat at the same table with big city police chiefs and prosecutors.  And because she did, she ended up shaping many of the recommendations of that task force.  And those recommendations are now being adopted across the country -- changes that many of the protesters called for.  If young activists like Brittany had refused to participate out of some sense of ideological purity, then those great ideas would have just remained ideas.  But she did participate.  And that’s how change happens.

He doesn't need it, AFAIK.  The President dominates foreign policy in the US.  The checks and balances mostly deal with internal matters.

Trump couldn't establish a new treaty without ratification, but he could withdraw over any amount of Congressional opposition.

Bush withdrew from the [Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty) without Congressional involvement.

http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/12/13/rec.bush.abm/

&gt;The President of the United States has executive authority to negotiate or withdraw the United States from treaties without seeking congressional approval. The Senate has authority only to ratify treaties.

----

&gt;Plus I doubt the war hawks in the Republican party want to overturn 60 years of the most powerful military alliance in history.

If he hypothetically strongly wanted to do so, he could do so even if every legislator from every party were opposed. The Republican Party has no direct control over Trump once he wins the general election.

What riches do the Ironborn obtain from the North? Yes they can snatch up some thralls or salt wives, but the North does not have the wealth of the Reach or the Westerlands. The wolfswood is the only real boon from the North. Balon can't keep those lands he's taken without significant help from a faction on the mainland. 

At some point down the line the wars on the continent will end. Then the Iron Throne is going to kick the Ironborn out.

These things are not opposites, rather they are complementary. Attractive people are more well-liked very generally. Attractive people are trusted more than the rest of us [(Wilson &amp; Eckel 2006)](http://static.cbslocal.com/station/ktvt/EckelWilsonAttractiveness.pdf): 

&gt; Attractive trustees are viewed as more trustworthy; they are trusted at higher rates and as a consequence earn more

Attractive children are viewed as being more intelligent, more likely to succeed and popular by teachers [(Clifford &amp; Walster 1973)](http://math.coe.uga.edu/prime/Methods/Expectations.pdf)

Attractive people are more persuasive [(Chaiken 1979)](https://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/Chaiken_JPSP_1979.pdf):

&gt; These findings suggest that attractive individuals may be more persuasive than unattractive persons 

Finally, attractive people are more popular [(Dijkstra &amp; Lindenberg 2009)](http://www.ppsw.rug.nl/~veenstra/CV/TRAILS_Dijkstra_JRA09.pdf).

There are many more similar studies that show that the same physical traits that make people sexually attractive (beautiful) also makes them more socially successful, richer, more well-liked, etc, etc.

&gt; The political power of Assyria was gone, but its people, culture and religion lived on. The Achaemenids preferred not to interfere in the internal affairs of their satrapies as long as the  flow  of  tribute  and  taxes  continued  undisturbed  (Dandamayev  and  Lukonin  1989,  104).  This was no problem in Assyria, whose population continued to venerate the Great King as the source of peace and security...The  210  years  of  Achaemenid  rule  thus  helped  preserve  the  Assyrian  identity  of  the  Aramaic-speaking peoples. Although the times of Assyrian hegemony were over, the satrapy of AӨūra kept Assyria on the map as a political entity and its inhabitants as Assyrians in the eyes  of  the  contemporary  world.  Paradoxically,  the  period  of  massacres  and  persecutions  following  the  fall  of  Nineveh  seems  to  have  strengthened  their  national  and  ethnic  identity.  The  last  king  of  Babylon,  Nabonidus,  who  was  of  Assyrian  extraction,  reverted  to  Assyrian  royal titulature and style in his inscriptions and openly promoted Assyrian religion and culture, evidently as a chauvinistic reaction against the Chaldean dynasty from which he had usurped power (Mayer 1998). **No wonder the Greek historians Herodotus and Xenophon remembered him as an Assyrian king.**

While I appreciate the world building that GRRM does in AFFC/ADWD, and I would not want to remove the experience of being on the Iron Islands or in Dorne, there was a lot of material there. I think it is possible that the narrative would have been better served by taking some of those POV chapters out and progressing through the story at a brisker pace, letting more things happen off page, and allowing both locations to retain some mystique that is lost when the regions are over-described. There are really just too many Greyjoy chapters for my taste, and my interest in the Iron Islands has suffered for it. But, maybe I'm just full of crap, because the more I've experienced Dorne, the more I've enjoyed it, especially upon rereading.

I have not yet read it in the Feast for Dragons order, but I would really like to. Doing so would solve some of the other problems I've had with those two books. I find the split between AFFC and ADWD, forcing you to jump backward into the timeline to catch up with characters you haven't seen for an entire book, to be rather jarring, and takes me out of the story. I would have much rather had a book that was weaker than the others because it lacked as many major events but moved every storyline forward, followed by a book filled with climactic moments that were set up by the book before it.

I did the generic Barclay Rewards Mastercard. They gave me 1000 points (worth $10) after first use. Any remaining Arrival+ points also converted, which was nice. I had about $8 worth left on the A+ but couldn't use them because minimum $100 redemption. Once they became generic Rewards points it was much easier to use them. I think the minimum is $25 for those, so doing 2 $500 VGCs gave me enough spending points that I could do a redemption once I added them to the $18 of original+bonus.

To anyone doing this, I wouldn't recommend doing the downgrade with $300 worth of points on the A+, though. Not sure if there is a limit to how many points they're willing to convert.

- yes, i agree. but you also agreed that this field has under represented minorities in it. the industry needs to develop talent in different job functions in order to change the industry in order to more accurately reflect america today.

""how could a man ever write a complex woman?""

-the question is not ability, but representation. just because one male was successful in creating one good female character, doesnt necessarily mean other males will be able to reproduce the same quality female character consistently. one would assume that a woman artist would more than likely be able to bring in those ingredients to create quality female characters because of her life experience as a female.

""But there are universal truths about the human condition that are more important than the color of the writers skin.""

-there are universal truths to the world we live in but, everyone has their own unique perspective about the world around them. it's important that the industry is digging for talent in a more diverse candidacy pool. the question is not, if white people can create quality art, we know they can, but can minorities also create quality material? and if they can, then why are they still under represented in the industry at different levels of the creative process?

i personally believe that the entertainment industry is a hard one for outsiders to crack, and is full of nepotism and 'who you know' politics behind it. there is minority talent out there, but they're not being hired on par as their white counter parts for jobs both in front of, or behind the camera.

1. Includes the i3-6100. This CPU is simply better than the aging 860k in the media elite build. Plus, it has a faaar greater upgrade path than the 860k.  
2. Because we went with the i3, we have to go with a new motherboard, and different RAM. The motherboard isn't anything special, but it has the basics. The RAM has doubled here compared to the media elite, and we're running DDR4, which is simply newer.  
3. An EVGA PSU. The Corsair one may be semi-modular, but it's a tier lower (Tier 4) than the EVGA one (Tier 3). I'd much rather have a more reliable PSU over one that may not be.  
4. A different and cheaper case. Personal preference simply dictates this one. I think the case in real life looks better than the product page photos.

4209	"&gt;Buy a 1080p phone then

Unfortunately, most manufacturers seem to think that people who want 1080p displays want mid-range phones, so the choices here are very limited.

&gt;VR with phones though is a great idea and I'm personally really excited for the future of it.

I don't see the point of it. Other devices are much more capable of powering VR; people should be focusing on lowering the prices of those rather than using phones for VR. Phones are ill-suited to the task due to performance limitations. Also, virtual reality requires you to be in a controlled environment (such as your living room) due to the fact that you can't see what's going on around you. So why harness the processing power of a phone when you have the ability to keep a much more powerful device in the room? The main advantage that phones have over PCs is portability, and that factor is completely irrelevant with VR.

What is interesting is AR, with systems like Google Glass and (more impressively) the Microsoft Hololens. These devices could potentially revolutionize the way people interact with technology; imagine if your house has absolutely no physical computer screens in it, and instead, everything you do is rendered on top of the real world. But that is a completely different technology to VR, and requires a different type of display to achieve.

&gt; I'll probably never be able to afford a vive and pc to run it, but down the line I might be able to buy a high res phone and headset.

AMD's RX480 is almost as powerful as a GTX 970 and costs $200. One of those with an i5 will put you at around $400USD total for the most expensive components. DDR4 is really cheap, so RAM's pretty easy. Storage costs (on both the HDD and SSD fronts) have been dropping significantly over the last few years. The point I'm trying to make is that you can easily build a machine that will max pretty much every single game on the market for $700USD - the HMD is the only expensive part, but the price for head mounted displays will also drop significantly. The prices for the Vive and Rift will decrease dramatically as the technology becomes more mainstream. It'll be less than $1000USD all-in for a fantastic VR experience soon enough - and that will absolutely destroy the best that phone-based VR has to offer. Yep, it costs more (especially right now), but it's hardly outside of the realms of possibility for the average person - especially because mid-range graphics solutions are already starting to take shape (such as the GTX 1060), and mid-range HMDs are just on the horizon.

Plus, you can always upgrade the computer. If you opt for an 8GB RX480, you could just buy a second one down the line and double your performance for the price of a second graphics card. Processor performance is moving much more slowly than graphics performance right now, so if you build a good base system, then you can easily improve your performance for very little money when a new GPU comes along (as opposed to having to buy a brand new flagship phone)."

Unless your burger is made of just beef, and was ground in front of you that very day you butchered the cow, you best be cooking it all the way through.

When meat gets ground up, all the bacteria that normally resides on only the surface of the meat gets mixed into the ground beef that gets turned into your burger.

It is possible that you and others have had medium rare burgers that didn't make them sick, but that was only due to you and them being lucky. 

Anyways, this very fact is the reason why people can eat blue rare steaks. The bacteria is only on the outside provided the meat hasn't begun to actually rot past a point of edibility. 

To explain that last bit about rot. There is this thing done with beef by some people called aging. Essentially they let it hang for a few days in a controlled environment. Essentially letting it rot slowly just enough to impart a flavor and I think even make the meat more tender. 

So yeah, Beef is a tricky mistress. You can do some things with it, but you really shouldn't do other things with it, like cooking a beef burger medium rare if not ground the day you butchered the cow.

4342	"No, it is God. God is the one who speaks through the Bible. It is the Holy Spirit, it is God, which inspired the writers to write what they wrote. It is God who gave them the knowledge to know what they knew. It is God who gave Moses the knowledge of Adam and the first generations which existed before the flood. God is the one who gave the facts which Moses had no way of knowing himself.

The Bible testifies of the truth of itself, and the same Spirit inspired all of it. It is all of God. It is all the word of God. It is the truth of God as He revealed it, and then preserved it as Scripture. God revealed Himself to the nation of Israel. Abraham believed in God. He knew God. He was in communication with God. He was in direct contact with God. So too was Moses. Even Adam knew God in the flesh. He walked with Him in the garden. Even Cain and Abel both knew God.

God has been working with and in contact with mankind since the beginning: at least with those who have believed in Him and believed His word, and trusted His word. Abraham was willing to kill his beloved son if it was God's will, born miraculously by the promise of God from a woman who had not been fertile for decades. Abraham surely knew that the child came from God, and that God could also take the child if He willed it. He submitted himself to God and was willing to take his son's life, but it turned out that this was not what God desired. God does not revel in the shedding of innocent blood. Abraham's faith was counted for righteousness.

God is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. He is also the God of Israel. Jesus Christ came in fulfillment of the prophecies preserved in the Scriptures of Israel - the Old Testament. The authority of the Old Testament was upheld by Jesus as well as His Apostles. The authority of Scripture was upheld and confirmed.

All Scripture is given by inspiration of God. The New Testament is also Scripture. The Bible is the inerrant word of God. God preserved it for us as is fully within His infinite power to do. God wanted us to be able to know the truth of Him, to be able to verify it ourselves. The Bible is the objective authority which we were given by God in order to know the truth of Him, ourselves, and our existence upon the earth.

2 Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 17 that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

Psalm 12:6 The words of the Lord are pure words:
as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
7 Thou shalt keep them, O Lord,
thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

Matthew 24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

4362	"One that I have some knowledge of its history, but would not call myself an expert is Modern Hebrew.

Hebrew as a language is not one thing. Hebrew of 1100B.C.E., called Paleo-Hrebrew, has little in common with Biblical Hebrew of 0 A.D. Paleo-Hebrew's closest language are the various Phoenician languages and scripts.  Biblical Hebrew became 'dead' or 'frozen' that way due to its use only for religious affairs as the diaspora adopted or came up with new languages to match local environments.  In fact, Judeans during Roman rule did not use Biblical Hebrew for ordinary affairs, but a related language that is still used among some small ethnicities, Aramaic. Some examples of these hybrid languages are Yiddish and Ladino among many others.  

Biblical Hebrew is sometimes divided even further by epochs into Biblical Hebrew up to 3rd century B.C.E, Mishnaic Hebrew until 6th century C.E, and Medieval Hebrew up to about the 13th century.  There are more obscure variations from the few Jewish kingdoms not in the traditional Jewish homeland such as Aksum Hebrew and Khazarian Hebrew, of which little survives.

As the Zionist movement encouraged population movement to Palestine starting in the late 19th century there was no real agreement about what language to use in the nascent Yishuv (Jewish community in Palestine).  

Modern Hebrew, which won out among the other contenders such as French, English, German, and Yiddish among others is not the Biblical Hebrew.  Jewish lexicographer Eliezar Ben-Yehuda is the most widely credited person for the initial work of reviving and modernizing Hebrew.  He and his family moved to Ottomon Palestine in 1881 and did his best to throw away from his personal life rituals and traditions he believed rooted in diasporan tradition.  Part of this was his work on updating Hebrew, which he considered an absolute requirement for the reemergence of a Jewish nation.

Ben-Yehuda is the founder of the official body that governs Modern Hebrew, the Academy of the Hebrew Language.   Of course, by far the biggest influence was Biblical Hebrew, but hardly the only one.  By far the biggest influence after Biblical Hebrew is Arabic, which Ben-Yehuda believed incorrectly, is a language descendant from Biblical Hebrew. Modern Hebrew is littered with 'loanwords' and a variety of slightly altered Arabic forms.  After that comes some influence by Aramaic and to a much much lesser extent Phoenician and Egyptian of the Ptolemaic era.  

Not all of his ideas were adopted and do not make appearances in Modern Hebrew.  Thousands of words Ben-Yehuda invented never made widespread use.  And due to Modern Hebrew's polyglot history Hebrew speakers are very quick to adopt the words of other languages rather than invent their own, much to the Academy's displeasure.  Major influences today include English, especially when it comes to science and technology, and Russian, of which over 1 in 7 Israelis are first generation immigrants from that region of the world.

I know this does not answer your question on HOW Hebrew was simplified.  I am not qualified to answer that question, but can at least give a very general overview of the history of what happened."	FALSE

Besides look at it like this, in a single year if you total costs for driving in Ontario and compare it to costs in Michigan, policy like this, increases the cost of doing business in Ontario (maybe the reason why GM is in the process of moving from Ontario to Michigan).

Cost to drive a car in Ontario in a month
Insurance - $100-$300 - In my experience rates in Ontario were about double what it was in Michigan

Gas - 30-40% higher in Ontario (literally compare Detroit to Windsor)

Registration - Has increased by ~20% in each of the last 4 years as evidence by post

If this is the case with residential transport, think about how this will affect commercial transport, similar trends.

I guess I don't understand this question? Could you explain?

&gt; I am wary of the guise of ownership when any possession I own I have the freedom to do with it as I please.. rather it is a share of ownership

You can do whatever you please with the stock you purchase. If you buy Class A stock you're directly involved as you want with management. Have enough of it you can control company direction or control who serves on the board. You also have the freedom to sell that stock at whatever price the market will accept. 

&gt; Even then, many people that buy stocks these days rely on others to purchase shares at a higher price, being that's how a great deal of profit is made.

Right...what's the problem here? You make an investment with the hope of that investment growing. Or you can bet against that stock and short it when the price drops. 

&gt; To me, stocks have no value and are misrepresented. Are there people who received money from the selling of the company and dividends who made money? Not counting the selling of shares to other stock holders.

Yes...every day. Personal example, I bought into and was granted stock at a company I worked for a few years ago. Wasn't a huge amount, but when the company was sold to a private group I earned about $2.5k on the sale plus my original investment back. "	FALSE

We find more dinosaur fossils because dinosaurs lived for a much longer time period, 135 million years compared to less than 200,000 years for modern humans, and thus left a bigger mark on the fossil record.  If all fossils date from basically the same time period, then that suggests that the early earth was absolutely packed to the gills with giant sea snails and a disgusting amount of micro-animals such as plankton.

I had one crazy game against a druid where I shadowcasted shadowcasters and brann once (for a total of three branns, so always assured shadowcast proc with  a 1 mana brann to pop on a turn if needed) and I had mini thaurissans, mini twin emperors branning into more big taunts and the c'thun rogue card that eats stats i kept shadowcasting. my c'thun had nearly 50 in both stats by the time I dropped him on the poor guy. good god almighty. i was also shadowcasting apothecary repeatedly. games ont hat scale were rare, and the double thaurissan proc are what enabled it to that degree, but i do manage shadowcaster shenanigans often on a smaller scale and twin emperors is one my go to for that especially if I can manage to turn 7 against agro with enough health to make it past poppes like kill commands by then. the first day or two, people were often hitting the duplicate emperor, which made it easy to shadowcast the main the next turn lol.

4594	"I may be slightly biased and rant-ish, experiencing the flip side of this firsthand. Because of the fact that my family could be considered well off. I will try to explain my thought processes when confronted with similar circumstances as your friend hopefully it will give you some insight. Keep in mind these are my honest thought processes, I don't vocalize them.

For starters, I try not to talk about money as much as possible, I actually have shame around it. One of my favorite parts about college is the fact that no one about where I come from. If someone is friends or romantically interested in me it's because they truly like me. It's not a forefront worry in my mind when making friends, but eventually I have to think about it. 

I'm back home for the summer, and I was at the mall with some friends buying new stuff. I was talking about cheaper prices at another store for almost the same thing. One of my friends said: 

""You're a (last name), why do you care?"" 

I normally just don't respond to comments like these. Or laugh it off because it's a very awkward situation for me.

One reason I deny the claims of being well off is I don't want to seemed spoiled, and I avoid talks about money. I also hate people who flaunt their money just as much as anyone else.

Asking me to acknowledge my privilege verbally is a double edged sword. Not saying I have privilege says ""He is ignorant to my struggles, his wealth has sheltered him."" While saying I have privilege is ""He's spoiled, he knows he can get anything he wants."" 

Your friend is well aware of her privilege most likely, but to her the polite thing to do is to deny she has any. You saying she comes from privilege is like saying. 

""You haven't worked for anything you have today."" 

Maybe not to your mind, but to me anytime someone brings up money it is so they can shame me about having it. I don't want to be defined by the number of dollars in my bank account, as I'm sure you don't want to either.

Lastly, the reason I get annoyed with people commenting about money is due to the fact that I didn't choose who my family is. It's almost like I get shamed for being born. I can't change who I was born to anymore than you can.

Also think about this; If you were in your friends shoes, would you not take every advantage you could? To vacation around? Can you blame them for wanted to see all this beautiful world has to offer?

Custom hardware for gimmicks is pointless.  I'd rather have a universal back button than Force Touch.  You might consider that innovation.  It's rather meh for a lot of people including me.

And Lightning? Are you kidding me?  Another excuse to rob iOS users.  Why didn't they go with USB-C like they did on the new Macs?

Here's my prediction.  In two years, USB-C will be the universal standard on everything except the iPhone.  And it'll still be only the most hardcore fans who think Force Touch is more than a gimmick.

Note.  I've never said the Pixel is on par with the iPhone yet. I've said the gap will be closing.  And it will.  There's really not much more hardware innovations to be had.  Better camera? Sure.  But both sides are now hitting the limits of optics on a device of handheld proportions.  Durability?  Sure.  And it's likely the Pixel 2 will see IP68.  So what's left, marginal improvements in processor speed, displays and battery life that will all be largely imperceptible to the average user.

The innovation is all in software.  And guess what?  Cloud services matter.  Biggest reason for getting my wife a pixel and not a cheaper phone?  Camera and unlimited Photos storage.  We just had a baby.  And the new mom wants tons of pics and videos backed up.  You can do the math and tell me what that would cost on iOS.

I'd consider full migration to Apple if they were actually willing to let me avoid a monthly bill with equivalent services.  Everytime I think of moving Google's services are what keep me on their ecosystem.  Moreover, Apple has a way of purposely avoiding standards just to cost me money.  I can add functionality to old TVs with cheap chromecasts.  I can have music throughout the house with old speakers and cheap Chromecast audio.  My new TV has Cast built-in.  Super easy to teach my tech challenged spouse to use too.  Heck, even the Nest I installed integrates with the Google Home app.  With Apple?  No choice for audio.  And i have to buy a super expensive Apple TV for each TV set (the one I have atm was complimentary from Sling....).  

And in the end, this is what will hobble Apple.  The trend is for more built-in functionality that ""just works"" with all my stuff.  Apple seems to have lost that bit of their DNA with Steve Jobs.  I find myself actually pondering if someday a Chromebook might replace my Macbook Pro after I'm out of grad school.  Just because of ecosystem integration...."	FALSE

My point with the Consumers cutting costs thing was that I flipped the words Consumers and corporations. My point was that you didn't understand that you're point goes both ways and so it was pointless so to speak.

Disposable income cannot be thought of as a shared resource. It's not an area where anyone can just go and scoop some up. Any share of disposable income that you want you have to work for above and beyond the work of just going to get it. To make sure that I'm clear you have to negotiate a trade with someone else and order to get a piece of their disposable income. You do not have to negotiate with the air or water in order to pollute it or use it to make electricity. 

Tariffs are completely unethical and ineffective.  There on ethical because they restrict the freedom of people to trade with each other which restrict the freedom of people to make a living for themselves. They're ineffective because they raise the cost of goods above fair market value artificially which negatively affects both sellers and buyers. "	FALSE

I'm not very athletic and my parents never put me through any sports programs when I was a kid (didn't have them in our neighborhood so didn't find out about any). Obviously I wasn't very good at tennis and I knew that. All I wanted was to practice with people that knew what they were doing and hopefully could provide tips on helping me improve. I only started the sport a few weeks ago and I don't live anywhere near a tennis court so practice was limited. I could only go so far by myself with a friend who also had no idea of what we were doing. Somehow after reading the team page on the school website that pronounced ""everyone was welcome"" I went out and gave it a shot. Woke up early to go and everything. But clearly I wasn't meant for it as 10 mins after we did some basic drills the coach took me aside and basically told me I wasn't good enough for the team and implied to not come to practice anymore. I knew I wasn't good enough to play any matches and wasn't looking to;just wanted to practice with them, but apparently I'm not welcomed to even do that. The rest of that practice was super awkward and my anxiety and nervousness made me miss a lot and my self esteem for the rest of those 2 hours just plummeted. Still not over it completely but I guess now I'm somewhat more motivated to show him wrong...but there's still that dread that I'll never get good.

Based on what's repeated in the video, it really boils down to intelligence. You get a good tip, stop the right person, and you might safely take an illegal gun off the street.

It's also a fantastic film in general about community attitudes, whose fault some things are and aren't, etc. Highly recommend if you want to have a more informed view in discussions on this type of issue from both a police and community standpoint, and what can actually be done to at least try to improve the situation."

This is one of those stories that keeps coming up even though it has been proved false by very liberal publications like the LA times...

&gt;High deportation figures are misleading

&gt;But the portrait of a steadily increasing number of deportations rests on statistics that conceal almost as much as they disclose. A closer examination shows that immigrants living illegally in most of the continental U.S. are less likely to be deported today than before Obama came to office, according to immigration data.

&gt;Expulsions of people who are settled and working in the United States have fallen steadily since his first year in office, and are down more than 40% since 2009.

&gt;On the other side of the ledger, the number of people deported at or near the border has gone up — primarily as a result of changing who gets counted in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's deportation statistics.

When I was first approved for the CFU, I only recieved a credit limit of 500 but rearranged my limits to get the CFU up to 4500.

4883	"Transcript of the segment:

&gt;So Baylor's been a team we've been happily avoiding all offseason just by random fate. It feels very odd to talk about Baylor in terms of what you predict their football team is going to do given everything that's going on and given that that requires either some very messy wrangling with the football effects of a serious institiutional scandal that affects far more important things than football or ignoring it altogether and talking about it as if this were any other change in coach or transfer of athletes etc etc. The one thing I do want to say about the Baylor football situation is this: it is very easy for those of us who have no connection to Baylor to point and gawk and criticize, and we aren't wrong to do that - I think there's a limited value to that. What happened at Baylor was shameful, disappointing, disheartening to say the least. I hope that it motivates us to ask more about what our college football programs are doing...the ones that we DO care about, the ones that we do claim for ourselves. Because I guarantee you that most of the people on the outside looking in at Baylor thought this was a ""school doing it the right way"". This didnt happen because there were evil people working behind the scenes to undermine that...this happened because people didnt ask the right questions and people didnt look to see if the rules were being enforced, if the rules made sense, if there were structures in place to prevent people from going outside of their lane and acting improperly. And the truth is that I can't point to Florida for example and say ""oh these are the structures to prevent that from happening - here's how the police dept is walled off from the athletic dept such that there can't be any inappropriate blurring of those lines - here's what the athletic dept has in place to make sure that people bringing accusations of domestic violence or sexual assault are heard and thoroughly and quickly investigated""...I don't know what those are, and that's a failure on my part. My main takeaway is I hope we don't just look at Baylor and say ""what a dark spot on CFB's soul, let's just burn it out so the rest of us can go about our business"". It's a sobering moment that should make us question all of our other schools that we claim to love and make sure that they aren't making the same mistakes that eventually blow up this horrifically and with this much human cost."

&gt; SINGAPORE Bigger ships could mean bigger paydays for commodity producers when the expanded Panama Canal opens this weekend as they can utilize larger vessels more frequently to tap into fast growing Asia-Pacific consumer markets.

&gt; Natural gas producers, container shippers, and coal miners hope to be among the winners when the expanded Panama Canal is inaugurated on Sunday at a cost of $5.2 billion and after a two-year delay.

&gt; Colombian shippers hope the bigger canal will open up trade to Asia as rising natural gas and renewable energy usage has cut coal consumption in its traditional North American and European markets.

The math won't ever add up to 8-9 months in such a scenario if you take the assumed birthdates for both characters.

If Dany is born essentially 9 months after the Trident, as Aerys rapes Rhaella after burning Chelsted and the new Hand Rossart only reigns for a fortnight before dying during the Sack, then Jon also is born around the time of the Trident, or up to a month later.

The Sack is known to have occurred a year into the war. The siege of Storm's End is also known to have lasted a year before Eddard ends it. The beginning of the war is when Jon Arryn calls his banners. The beginning of the Siege of Storm's End isn't until at least after the Battle of Ashford as the Tyrell forces which will be sieging Storm's End are at Ashford beating Robert (AKA not at Storm's End). The Battle of Ashford however is a few months into the war. If the Siege ends a year after the first few months of the war, then the time between the Sack and the Siege needs to be a few months also for the Siege to last its year.

Then Eddard still needs to get from Storm's End to the TOJ. A journey that is at least many weeks of travelling. And that's assuming he went straight from Storm's End to the TOJ, something that never actually is said.

So already, between the Sack and the TOJ, we can establish that we've got a period of like 2-3 months. If Jon is born at the time of the Trident, or a month later, then he's already basically 2-3 months old at the TOJ. And therefore Jon can't possibly be born at the TOJ as Ned is arriving, or shortly before it, or any time frame that involves Lyanna dying giving birth to him, like fans think he is.

If you assume that Jon is born at the TOJ shortly before Ned arrives, then you will get that Jon is 5-6 months older than Dany, not 8-9. So Jon can't simultaneously be born shortly before the TOJ and Dany born 9 months after the Trident, as is what's generally assume by the fans. You won't get Martin's statement that Jon is 8-9 months older than Dany, you'll get that he's 5-6 months older. So therefore either Jon isn't born shortly before the TOJ like fans think he is, or Dany isn't born 9 months after the Trident like she thinks she is. 

It has nothing to do with disagreeing with GRRM here, it has everything to do with agreeing with him. Per GRRM's own words as you put it, Jon can't be born when fans believe he's born if Dany is born when Dany thinks she's born. That won't give you Martin's 8-9 month statement. The only possible solution is that the fan belief about Jon's birthday is wrong, or that Dany's belief about her own birthday is wrong. Either way, somebody's got the wrong birthday here. That's a fact that's consistent with everything Martin's written in the books, and everything that Martin's said in SSM's. Jon can't simultaneously be 8-9 months older than Dany if he's born at the time of the TOJ and Dany is born 9 months after the Trident. That would make him 5-6 months older than Dany, AKA not what Martin said. 

Either the fandom is wrong about Jon, or Dany is wrong about herself. I am agreeing with Martin here, it's you that's going against him."	FALSE

What are these abuses in patent law? 

Furthermore, if you against patents all together, how to you propose we provide incentive to companies to develop new products? Patents are in place to allow companies to produce products knowing that, for at least a given period of time, they will have exclusive selling rights to the product that they have spent their money to develop.

&gt;I'm just against the idea of powerful organizations imposing their will over the powerless for their own personal gain at the expense of others.

I don't really understand how patents do this? Farmers are free to purchase seed from any company they wish. They are also free to purchase unpatented seeds. Patented seeds are purchased because they are profitable. So I fail to see how organizations are somehow imposing their will on the powerless for the expense of others when the so-called powerless are able to choose their own method and profit from it independently.

We used to be at a this subreddit where there was no criteria written for what we dictated as ""high-effort"" content &amp; ""low-effort.""  

Gif posts used to be removed arbitrarily because one mod considered ""low-effort."" We resolved that in in the rules by unbanning gif posts &amp; letting users (&amp; the rest of rules) decide.

The mods (&amp; the users) had trouble determining how many pictures in an imgur album was ""high-effort"" enough (resulting in arbitrary removals), so they created a criteria of requiring albums of 3 or more images so that they &amp; everyone else knew what was okay to post.

There does not need to be a change of enforcement in the rules, doing that results in the mods having to justify why one post was arbitrarily allowed or removed. 

It would be better for the mods to create better criteria of the rules to allow or ban certain content, rather than then to arbitrarily allow   certain  content while it is clearly breaking the rules. 

Anime music videos were more grey area content of whether they were or were not allowed or not (though they did sort of confirm that when they were not allowed after not allowing Me! Me!

5187	"It can be helpful to sit down and try to draw a photorealistic image. Seriously. I suggest doing it right now. Draw your desk and everything on it exactly as they are, without using grids, measurements, perspective lines, or other ""cheats"" that Renaissance artists developed. Just draw precisely what you see. 

You may have *perfect* penmanship and eye-hand coordination, but you'll probably still discover that what you've drawn doesn't match what you see in real life. You will almost certainly get angles and proportions incorrect (even artists who've be practicing mindfully for years get these wrong if they aren't careful or don't use aforesaid ""cheats"").

What's going on there? Interpretation. Your brain looks at all the shapes and colors presented to it by your eyes. Then it identifies the objects you're seeing, and it retrieves data it knows about them. For example, it knows what your desk would look like from any angle. It can guess the hardness and texture of your desk. It knows where the desk ends and the object on it begins. It know what those objects look like from different angles. What they likely feel like, how heavy they likely are, where their centers of mass likely are, etc. It's making assumptions about what color everything would appear under bright daylight, under artificial light, or in shadow.

All of this information is noise. It distracts you from drawing *only* what you see. Instead of blindly copying what your *eyes* have gathered, you find yourself influenced by your brain's interpretations. It's very, very hard to bypass this; Even when you know you're being fooled (such as in the case of optical illusions), it can be very hard to ignore your brain's faulty assumptions. Our brain's visual system is *marvellously* intelligent and advanced, and it stick its fingers in everything we see. 

Artists have to overcome all that, and that takes a lot of practice and a certain amount of cheating—like using rulers, blocking in with abstract shapes, drawing silhouettes, sometimes even drawing upside down!

So one could on one hand view the tree as a picture of the Church, growing in the life of Christ, bearing fruit in the Apostles and healing the nations.

However, as 22:14 speaks of the saints as those with the right to eat of the tree, we may need to see it purely as Eden imagery, or as a picture of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is elsewhere pictured in the book as a tree, recalling imagery from Ezekiel.

1 person. That is a personal anecdote. ""This is what happened to me"". That's great. 50% of students aren't so lucky. 

&gt; You're telling me students have no choice but to rake up a shit lot of debt. 

No, I'm saying for 50% of students, significant debt accumulation, well beyond your definition of ""reasonable"" is the lived reality. I've also pointed to several reasons why this reality exists. I've been very clear that a significant number of people can graduate without debt.

&gt;you are just wrongly focused on backing everything by sources even when it's not necessary. 

You can't just throw out an opinion with nothing to back it up. You have done absolutely nothing to back up any point you've made. Nothing. You have pointed to nothing. You're making baseless statements and accusations against people you've never met. That's not what a public policy debate is. 

&gt;I believe that any student should be able to make at least 15k every year

Based on what? You can't just say I believe anyone should be able to do that, and have nothing back up why that should be a reasonable assumption. You're entire argument boils down to random assumptions. We do not make public policy on assumptions. 

&gt; And don't you tell me it's impossible to find jobs that pay $15).

Why would I? I had a couple jobs while in school that paid that. I had 1 that paid better. So what? Not everyone can work. Take a look at unemployment rates. That only measures people looking for work. Youth unemployment shows that over 1 in 10 are looking for work, and can't find it. 

&gt;I also think that students could just work before university and save money.

At student wage? Student wage in Ontario went up in 2015 to $10.55. You're already almost $5 per hour short on your assumption. 

&gt;It's not that hard. 

Baseless assumption. 

I can see that no facts can sway you, because you don't let facts get in the way of your opinion. That's certainly AN approach, not one I would recommend though.

5294	"&gt;So I think I've gotten a much better grasp with it but am simply wondering what is intrinsic to the electric dipole moment operator such that it reverses parity, while the magnetic dipole moment operator reverses it?

Parity is the operation which takes **r** to -**r**. The dipole moment operator is proportional to **r**, so it switches sign.

The magnetic dipole moment operator is proportional to **L**, which doesn't change under parity.

&gt;Is there an analog with the dipole operators? If we were in another frame, would this magnetic dipole operator appear to be an electric dipole operator? Would parity change in one frame and not the other?

I'm not sure, but it appears at first glance that both electric and magnetic multipole operators would have nontrivial transformations under Lorentz boosts. Except the trivial case of the electric monopole moment (charge), which is Lorentz-invariant."	FALSE

&gt; * NEW DELHI: Once the central or state government fixes and notifies the retail sale price, retailers cannot sell essential commodities such as pulses milk and edible oils at higher prices in the guise of selling such items in packets.Learning from recent experiences of exceptional spurt in prices of pulses and particularly huge difference between loose dal and those sold in packets, the consumer affairs ministry has modified the legal matrology (packaged commodities) rules enabling governments to fix retail prices.The modification says, ""If the retail sale price of any essential commodity is fixed and notified by the competent authority under the Essential Commodities Act, the same shall apply.

&gt; * ""The notification issued on September 7 also says once the government fixes and notifies the standard quantity such as 500 grams, one kg or two kg , the retailers will have to comply with the norms.Officials said violation of packaged commodities rules can invite a fine of Rs 5,000 and detaining of the entire stock.

&gt; * Maharashtra is also working to enact a law to fix MRP when there is spurt and to curb hoarding.In July, the consumer affairs ministry had urged states to consider a pricing policy for pulses and such other essential food items and to make it enforceable for all stakeholders to cap the prices of essential commodities.Section 2 of the Essential Commodities Act, which deals with powers to control production, supply and distribution of essential commodities, empowers the Centre to ask states to act.

&gt; * As per the law, states can take necessary steps to control the price at which essential commodities are bought or sold.

5366	"&gt;  Some form of marriage occurs across all known cultures in the anthropological record, not only capitalist ones.

This is only true if you have such a broad definition of marriage that it essentially encompasses every sort of sexual relationship.  In Musuo culture for instance someone might be ""married"" to a variety of partners at once, ""marriages"" are formed whenever a man visits a woman at night, and ""marriages"" are sometimes formed and dissolved over the course of a given night.

Monogamy within marriage in particular is also somewhat of a strange phenominon.  They currently aren't the norm in most societies, and weren't really even the norm in Western civilization until the 19th century, after the development of capitalism.  The rights of men to seek out mistresses were pretty well protected, even though any children produced by those couplings would be disavowed.

The genetic and cultural evidence supports the notion that monogamous marriage developed with the invention of the plow, with that being the strongest predictor of whether or not a culture promotes monogamy.

Likewise, in many cultures marriages needn't actually be consented to by the women taking part in them for them to be binding.

Monogamous, consensual, committed marriage is actually a historical rarity.  We regard 'marriage' as a human universal only because we use definitions that do not require any of those conditions, but I would argue that such a definition is pretty distinct from what laymen call ""marriage"". Doing away with monogamous marriage thus is not a hugely difficult task if you're talking about what most people refer to as marriage."	FALSE

5443	"When you say historiography, what exactly are you picturing? Do you want to understand the changes in the way historians have studied Rome or do you want to read books about various events of Roman history from different points of view? Either way I would start with a textbook overview. Something like H.H. Scullard's *From the Gracchi to Nero* which covers the most well-known and well-sourced period of Roman history 133 BCE - 64 CE. If you want something more scholarly, I suggest you check out the Cambridge Ancient History volumes 7 and onwards. It's split into articles that have overviews of different topics. The reading list in the wiki has plenty of good suggestions. I would also recommend reading the primary sources like Polybius, Livy, Plutarch, and Suetonius. The early books of Livy (1-10) and the early lives of Plutarch (Numa) are impossible to tell history from legend, just to warn you.

As for understanding how historians have changed, I will admit that I do not follow the study of early Rome, so I can't help you there. I consider it a hopeless case to decipher the truth from the legends and use it only as a way to explain Roman morals, like many historians (and even Livy himself). For the more grounded portions of Roman history I would begin with Gelzer's *The Roman Nobility*. Gelzer was the first person to propose that Rome was dominated by ancestral, permanent bonds that allowed a small oligarchy to dominate politics. From there you can read Lily Ross Taylor's *Party Politics in the Age of Caesar* and Syme's *The Roman Revolution*. Both authors use Gelzer's theory and expand upon it to explain the explosive political atmosphere of the late Republic and the success of Augustus, respectively. Next you can scope out P.A. Brunt's articles on the *Clientele* and *Amicitia* which are a dismantling of Gelzer and ""The Army and the Land"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Republic"" which are his alternate view of the social forces which aided the creation of the Empire. Gruen's *The Last Generation of the Roman Republic* gives a narrative from 70-45 that removes the Gelzer effect. A couple of articles from Fergus Millar about the *Contio* and the *comitia*, published in the '90s went even further from Gelzer and argued that we can view Rome as a basically democratic society. He has been confronted by Henrik Mouritsen's *Plebs and Politics in the Late Republic* and Robert Morstein-Marx's *Mass Oratory* both of which argue for elite control through institutions if not through direct reciprocal bonds. Both are heavily indebted to Christian Meier's *Res Publica Amissa* a German work which has not been translated into English but which essentially argued that Roman politics ran on a set of cultural norms (the mos maiorum) which empowered the elite. This more or less brings you up to the current state of the historiography of Roman politics (though a lot of articles are now being published pushing back on Mouritsen and Morstein-Marx, one of which was written by Morstein-Marx).

At any rate, I'm sure this post has made it clear that Roman historiography is quite extensive. You also have entirely different historiographies for Roman Law, Roman provinces and expansion, the Roman Empire, Roman religion, and Early Rome, so let me know if you want a little more guidance.

5508	"I have a few ideas for different ways to fix this, some of them OK, and some of them crappy. Any of them could be done alone, or in combination. I'm not a coder, so I don't know how easy any of these would be to implement:

1. Restrict referrals to accounts that have more than [100, 200, 400, 800, etc.] karma from /r/churning - this seems to be the easiest and cleanest solution, and will probably get you the best results at the lowest cost. It also continues to allow anyone to post referrals, as long as they put in their time being useful/helpful/active in the sub.
2. Only allow referral links (reject any post that isn't composed entirely of an http link?), and no other text of any sort, in the referral post.
3. [Probably more coding than you all want to do:] Referrals are submitted via a Google Form. Duplicate referral codes are automatically deleted, and if desired the user banned from submitting additional referrals. Users then request a referral for a particular card from [some form somewhere], and they are PMed a referral code for that card only. The referral code is then moved to the back of the line, so all referral codes are cycled through before a code is used a second time.
4. [Either my best or worst idea:] Instead of having referral threads for each card, have one master referral thread, and each user gets one post, in which the user lists links for the cards he/she has referrals for. It would make navigating referrals slightly harder, but it might push people towards using referral links according to users/karma/etc., rather than according to random chance (which helps people who go through the hoops necessary to post multiple referral links).

That's all I've got for now. I think #1 is the way to go, and should get you/us the best results with relatively low effort."	FALSE

Wouldn't it be so freeing just to let all of the mundane shit we deal with just to be whatever it is?  Let it all just fall apart.  Use this as a chance to start fresh from the bottom and rebuild your life.  You have dreams that you may have put on the backburner and this could be a wakeup call for you to get back on track with those dreams.  I have my own examples of how I've let stuff go and my credit has been ruined to the ground and I've been temporarily homeless.  I speak from experience that from my shitty Craigslist room for rent I had one summer that I had so much emotionally draining energy free up that allowed me to simply breathe again.  It was one of the most freeing beautiful moments of my life and I am on the fast track to chasing my dreams again... and who cares if I ever ""reach"" them... The fucking point is to enjoy the ride.  If you're not enjoying the ride it's going wrong somewhere.

Well, it's not really hard to argue that Trump would be better, I don't want to be disingenuous. It would be completely dishonest to say that he will hold onto anything that he says. However, the likelihood oh him supporting many further wars is much lesser than Hillary's. And ultimately that matters the most."	FALSE
5537	"Some of these are pretty characteristic of authoritarian regimes in general, some of these are just dead wrong. Fascism didn't reject modernity, it co-opted it, for example (see Jeffrey Herf's _Reactionary Modernism_ for a long discourse on this); to see fascism as an embrace of ""irrationality"" is not to take it seriously when it outlines its ""principles."" But personally while these are perhaps a very nice way of talking about authoritarian regimes in general, they are not specific to the ideology of Fascism — Eco is using it in a somewhat generic sense, I think.

If the answer is ""no"", then he CAN and DOES control this...he just doesn't care to control it around you and is totally ok subjecting you to his rages.  Just because they aren't ""aimed"" at you, doesn't mean they aren't affecting you greatly.  If he cared for you, he would control himself around you as well.  The first time he scared you or made you cry because of his reaction, he would have been filled with remorse, apologized, and done something immediately to fix it (like calling a counselor).  But he hasn't done that.

This isn't a straight up anger problem, because he can control it and chooses to let you suffer under it.  This is a red flag, and this is a possible precursor to abuse.  You need to issue your ultimatum, because this is and will continue to negatively impact you psychologically."	FALSE

Sony obviously capitalised on the extremes and made it out that all moderate human beings that didn't like the trailer like ourselves were like those few scumbags, but those scumbags certainly existed.

True, that could also be a factor. A lot of them he meets on OKCupid, but he does have a habit of dating some really trashy chicks and I'm not sure where he finds those (maybe also on OKC, I don't know.)

It's funny - his current gf is the result of him giving me control of his OKCupid account one night. I was browsing and found her and said, ""Date this girl! I want to be her friend!!!"" And they've been together for over a year now, heh.

Wait, are you saying that big-breasted women tend to be part of these circles? Because most models are fairly small-breasted, and I don't see why social class would have any correlation with breast size, unless we're talking about fake boobs in which case you might have a point. But naturally large-chested women are just as diverse in terms of personality as tall guys.

Now, if you're talking about girls who go out of their way to *flaunt* their big boobs, you're probably right. But my guess is, especially living near the beach, you just aren't noticing the big-busted girls who try to downplay their size.

The further one strays from existing flawed but workable systems the greater the probability of errors in theory will result in a net negative outcome from some misunderstood or unrealized problem. 

Trade offs being considered is another factored to be placed in the pro column. There are no solutions only trade offs. And while principles are important placing them above all considerations of practicality and trade offs can lead to worse outcomes, where pursuit of an ideal can lead to measures with a negative marginal utility. For example (almost) everyone agrees men and women should be compensated equally for equal work but in a hypothetical world where the wage gap as 1/100th of a cent per year  would adding additional bureaucratic and administrative measures to correct from that be worth it? If such measures incur costs of $100 per worker ($1.9 billion cost to the country as a whole) arguably such a modest gain in equality is not worth the reduced economic welfare overall. Women in such a scenario would be $99.9999 worse off as a result. The numbers maybe a little contrived in such an example but the general principle of examining trade offs is a sound one that all to often gets underplayed among those further to the left than (small L) liberals."

&gt;**Summary**

&gt;**Background**

&gt;Neuroimaging studies have shown structural alterations in several brain regions in children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Through the formation of the international ENIGMA ADHD Working Group, we aimed to address weaknesses of previous imaging studies and meta-analyses, namely inadequate sample size and methodological heterogeneity. We aimed to investigate whether there are structural differences in children and adults with ADHD compared with those without this diagnosis.

&gt;**Methods**

&gt;In this cross-sectional mega-analysis, we used the data from the international ENIGMA Working Group collaboration, which in the present analysis was frozen at Feb 8, 2015. Individual sites analysed structural T1-weighted MRI brain scans with harmonised protocols of individuals with ADHD compared with those who do not have this diagnosis. Our primary outcome was to assess case-control differences in subcortical structures and intracranial volume through pooling of all individual data from all cohorts in this collaboration. For this analysis, p values were significant at the false discovery rate corrected threshold of p=0·0156.

&gt;**Findings**

&gt;Our sample comprised 1713 participants with ADHD and 1529 controls from 23 sites with a median age of 14 years (range 4–63 years). The volumes of the accumbens (Cohen's d=−0·15), amygdala (d=−0·19), caudate (d=−0·11), hippocampus (d=−0·11), putamen (d=−0·14), and intracranial volume (d=−0·10) were smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls in the mega-analysis. There was no difference in volume size in the pallidum (p=0·95) and thalamus (p=0·39) between people with ADHD and controls. 

&gt;Exploratory lifespan modelling suggested a delay of maturation and a delay of degeneration, as effect sizes were highest in most subgroups of children (&lt;15 years) versus adults (&gt;21 years): in the accumbens (Cohen's d=−0·19 vs −0·10), amygdala (d=−0·18 vs −0·14), caudate (d=−0·13 vs −0·07), hippocampus (d=−0·12 vs −0·06), putamen (d=−0·18 vs −0·08), and intracranial volume (d=−0·14 vs 0·01). There was no difference between children and adults for the pallidum (p=0·79) or thalamus (p=0·89). Case-control differences in adults were non-significant (all p&gt;0·03). Psychostimulant medication use (all p&gt;0·15) or symptom scores (all p&gt;0·02) did not influence results, nor did the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders (all p&gt;0·5).

&gt;**Interpretation**

&gt;With the largest dataset to date, we add new knowledge about bilateral amygdala, accumbens, and hippocampus reductions in ADHD. We extend the brain maturation delay theory for ADHD to include subcortical structures and refute medication effects on brain volume suggested by earlier meta-analyses. Lifespan analyses suggest that, in the absence of well powered longitudinal studies, the ENIGMA cross-sectional sample across six decades of ages provides a means to generate hypotheses about lifespan trajectories in brain phenotypes.

So increasing revenue is one way to go about that. Sell more stuff. 

Also, decreasing expenses. Have a more efficient workforce, operate on less, and--here it is--decrease your taxes. Again, that's how you stay in business, grow, and hire more people.

So when you're thinking of it from the perspective of the business, you're trying to pay what you legally owe--**and only that**--so that you don't incur unnecessary expenses.

He was the son of an Albanian tobacco merchant and founded a dynasty that ruled until Nasser overthrew King Farouk in the 1950s.

The bigger issue isn't with enfranchisement, though, so much as it's with representation. In WA, for example, you can sign an affidavit under some circumstances allowing a surrogate to vote for you at the caucus.

Of course, this has one of two effects:

* the surrogate now counts for two or more immovable votes
* the person whose vote is in surrogacy has no knowledge of the arguments or positions which might ultimately ""sway"" their surrogate's vote

So now there are three dudes in each precinct with 2-3 ballots apiece, and they are almost all diehards, and suddenly the conversational, communal aspect of the caucus has been completely diluted by the electoral aspect. So we might as well just have used a ballot.

A ballot which is produced and counted by the state election board *regardless* of our behavior.

5841	"&gt; The controversy wasn't over how broken the game was to begin with (though it started off that way, another issue that, again, gets back to the ""getting a game at launch"" issue), but over ""lies."" The ultimate issue was the hype of the game being built to such extremes.

The ultimate issue wasn't the hype, even though the game was hyped up extremely. The issue was the lies, plain and simple. The hype surrounding it certainly compounded on people's feelings towards the final product, but if the game had been everything they said they would, then people wouldn't have gotten up in arms.

&gt; The relative response as a result of the lie is hugely disproportionate. It's like tearing a man apart by the limbs in response to some petty shoplifting.

I think you mean ""lies"" since he lied a TON of times about several features, not just multiplayer. A majority of the times he had talked about the game he told at least one lie about the game.

&gt; Ultimately, this has happened before with far less consequence or hooplah. The nature of this is very different.
The response has been incredibly overwhelmingly one-sidedly stupid, all pinned on the actions by someone where this behavior has been deemed acceptable for DECADES.

Give me an example of another time a lead dev of a game lied about their game as many times as Sean Murray. Studios lie about their games all the time, but I don't think there has ever been a single game that has even come close to the amount of deception surrounding it as NMS. 

&gt; Had Hello Games not advertised, they wouldn't have had nearly as much hype, and may have not been known. I don't exactly think Subnautica's doing amazingly well. And there's plenty of great indie games that are left by the wayside.

No one is saying they shouldn't have advertised, they should've at the very least just been more realistic as to what the final product was going to be, instead of toting all of these features that weren't even in the game.

&gt; But gamers are foolish, thinking that ""the best product will come to the top."" That's stupidity, the premise for which most people's arguments are coming from, the idiocy of their claims and the immaturity of their own beliefs. It's ultimately the reason why Hello Games did what they did, was acceptable in the past, created this behemoth of a response, and ultimately cannot quell it. It wouldn't have happened if gamers were responsible individuals as a whole, which they clearly aren't.

It also wouldn't have happened if Hello Games had been honest about NMS...

&gt; Ultimately, the point is no matter what ""wrong"" Hello Games and Murray had done, who the fuck cares? Wanting this weirdly abstract ""justice"" for something relatively minor (as the ruling provides) is ridiculous.

You do realize that the ASA's ruling was only in regards to the steam store page, right? I'd bet on my life that if the ASA investigated the entire marketing campaign for the game that Hello Games would've been in some very hot water. Also, in my opinion justice has already been served in the form of the destruction of their reputation as game developers. Their actions have dug them into a deep hole that is going to take a lot of work and trust building for them to climb out of. 

Listen, I agree with you that a lot of gamers are immature little shits. No one at Hello Games deserves death threats or the level of harrassment that they are receiving. HOWEVER, their anger towards Hello Games is totally justified considering what they did. I don't condone their actions, just their feelings towards the game and the company."	FALSE

That was a bit of hyperbole on my part. I look at the way he raised me as from a different generation and culture so I don't fault him for it. As to how he is as a person, he is one of the most respectful people I know and is the reason why I have tried my best to follow in that behavior.

As far as how he is as a father, there are a few things I've considered. Most people may have to make a sacrafice: holding a high paying position with the ability to provide for their family but not see them or hold a lower paying position and not have that same ability to provide for their family but may see them more often.

My dad's position requires him to travel extensively so he isn't home much. Religion and culture play a large part of his parenting style, though he did make the choice to act moderately and allow me to embrace the culture we live in.

There were points when I was younger that he wanted to take me to a psychiatrist but my mom felt the record of those visits would come back to haunt me.

His feelings that I was smart from a young age made him believe that I wasn't making mistakes, but intentional bad choices. These sentiments only grew worse during the period I was in high school. He more or less gave up on me.

I'm not saying this as justification for his actions, nor am I saying his actions don't constitute abuse. I guess I'm just understanding of where they came from, and while they may have been beneficial in his own upbringing, it's damaged me.

Everything I have in life is a reminder of how hard he's worked; my education, my home, my clothes, my car, and my mistakes. This is predominantly why I need to leave this house, because I feel like I can't seperate his negative effects on me when almost everything positive in my life has come from his own efforts. There is a lot that I have earned for myself but I just don't feel that it compares to what he's earned for me."	FALSE

I am a professional chef in a high end restaurant with a decade of experience and also studied food science for 5 years.

Edit: Also as others have said, if you heat something on a higher heat the outside is going to be overcooked before the inside has completely cooked, so you have to cook it at the correct temperature so that both the outside and the inside reach optimal temperatures at the correct moment.

 Transpeople cant be compared to blacks or gays or anyone else. Theyre not fighting for equal rights or to be able to love who they want to love. Theyre fighting because theyre upset that not enough people love them or believe in their ridiculous notion of gender. 

No one cared about trannies before and all this exposure did was make it worse for transwomen in ghetto areas who are now living in more danger than ever before over this stupid transtrend.

They make up less than 1% of society and want everyone to change because they dont feel validated enough by society. So clearly its everyone else that has to change not the tiny minority thst barely even exists.

this trans fad (because it is a fad) pretty much sprung out of nowhere and became a ""social issue"" over night after bruce jenner came out and its made life consideranly harder for transwomen in certain areas in terms of violent crime and is fading away just like any other fad. 

The fact anyone even pays attention to this trans nonsence boggles my mind. No ""gender revolution"" is coming because of it.

If you're not in the top 40%, your income has been stagnant for 50 years, if you're not in the top 20% your gains have been modest at best - it's not until you hit the top 5-10% that wealth is really growing, and by the time you hit the top 0.1% the rate of growth is nothing short of ridiculous.

The 0,0 coordinates of Kalimdor are in a mountain in Stonetalon, likewise 0,0 on Eastern Kingdoms is in the Alterac Mountains. There is even a boat floating there under the world to catch people who ended up there from the bug. Transports didn't get proper coordinates at the time, they're sort of their own mini instances inlaid within the world so they were just 0,0, which had some other amusing issues (youtube deathgrip on bootybay boat).

Here's forcing the Borean Tundra Zeppelin into Kalimdor, if you did this on a flying mount you could fly in the old world (while the server had you in Northrend): http://imgur.com/k5sCfM9

And a bit strange to understand, but here I'm standing in Darkshore looking up at the doodads and players in Dalaran: http://imgur.com/2Y3s5mk

With your specific case, you caused the map swap while on a regular object so you retained your instance coordinates from inside Deeprun Tram and the object stays visible as well - objects like mailboxes or chairs were useful when wanting to force this glitch map swap in specific locations so you didnt fall into the void or the ocean and get stuck in a disconnect loop.

Reuter said in July that he estimates SpaceX is spending about 10 times more than NASA’s planned expenditure on Red Dragon, or roughly $300 million.""

6094	"They were treated quite well. Since fugitive slave laws were still in place in the United States until 1862 when the Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves was passed which meant that any slave which was in a territory controlled by Northern troops was ipso facto free since they were really seen as contraband, essentially captured enemy property. 

Canada was where around 75% of all escaped slaves ended up, around 100,000 in total who mostly settled in Ontario since after all, it was the closest. In terms of if they were welcomed, they certainly were. A special order-in-council which received Royal Consent in 1855 which made it an official policy to accept runaway slaves and provide food, clothing and shelter to new arrivals, as well to arrest and imprison the bounty hunters/kidnappers sent from the slaves masters to return their property, were arrested at the border. As more and more waves came to Canada and began to adapt the environment (a stark contrast to the South) small towns of entirely escaped slaves began to form around the St.Lawrence and York (Toronto today) and Amhurstburg where some grew tobacco. 

Although the government and many citizens were tolerable and accepting of the newcomers, especially early on around 1830. But in 1850 as more and more came more citizens began to harbour racist views. Turing a blind eye to their struggle during their establishment and there were few cases of assaults and murdered against black immigrants. But you do have to consider that there is a potential number  of cases which were never recorded or reported due to these racist views, however there is no evidence of this. Institutionalized racism also meant it was harder for black immigrants to find work, government support or schooling.

However they did not tolerate this, after the Civil War in 1870 many began to expand into the West. Tired of the racism in the East they joined with many European immigrants moving into the praries to establish thriving cities like Calgary, Vancouver and Winnipeg. They were even invited by James Douglas (Governor of BC) to Victoria, where the first black politician held office (1871). As time went on many more Black immigrants became more established across the country and the abolition movement grew, Toronto even hosted the North American Convention of Colored Freeman.

And something to remember is that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves throughout the US. It only applied to states which seceded from the Union which left slavery untouched in the South and loyal border states. So many were not quick to return to the US as it a) cost money, most of which was spent getting to Canada b) is still dangerous and the war is still alive and c) emancipation was contingent on Union military victory, which would not offically occur until 1865, two years after the Emancipation Proclaimation.

Long story I won't get into here, but what I will say is that although my general opinion of people hasn't improved much, I've realized that hurting people or causing pain doesn't help anyone or anything. I would feel remorse over doing it, and others would just have pain for the rest of their life.

You take into account only part of message contained in the linked video. The main part is that representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood required in 1953 Naseer to force all Egyptian women wear hijab.

Nseer died in 1970. The Muslim Brotherhood won parliamentary election in 2011 and presidential in 2012. If general Sisi did not remove them by force they would have been at power forcing everybody not only hijabs.


Ad Hollande's blabber:

(I am not French so my comment is an opinion from outside.)

His words are not intended for French Muslims. He tries to address ethnically (?) French native non-Muslim people that are afraid of non-integrated (according some non-integrable) Muslims (allegedly) endangering or even destroying French culture and freedom.  His words are part of mass communication not a part of intellectuals' debate. He uses symbols, simple phrases and metaphors.

Marianne is symbol of liberty and of the (secular) republic. The liberty concept of French revolution time includes liberation from ""reactionary, deceiving, oppressive"" religion and its representatives. Revolution was long time ago but part of it is still present. French traditional secularism is atheistic tolerating (if at all) religion only like a private thing. 

*The concept of liberty encompasses right to criticize publicly any religion and particular beliefs. If a believer is allowed to express publicly his belief ""Allah is the only god and Muhammad is his prophet!"" any other person can publicly express ""There is no God!"" and question Muhammad's credibility or even his mental health regardless a believer is offended by it.*


Hijab (burka, burkini) become for large part of French a religious symbol representing women's (alleged?) unequal social status, dependency, even enslavement etc. Why this happened? There are many women forced to wear it not in Iran only. Of course there are women wanting to wear it. But the negative perception of it prevails. Hijab is also a symbol of refusing western life style, separation, creating an estranged subculture and ghetto. You can argue it is not truth etc. It is not important in this context.

6312	"&gt;I honestly found Morrowind to be bland and uninspired.

I respectfully disagree. I find it to be one of the more unique and rich game worlds, and was disappointed when Oblivion took the turn to the cliché medieval-chivalric-swords-and-horses style. Skyrim spiced things up a bit, but it's still an inch deep and a mile wide.

I'd hardly call Morrowind uninspired. Some of the best lore and visuals come from that game. I mean, which is uninspired: 50-foot-tall bugs with control sticks directly in their brains for transportation, or horses and carts? Forests of giant mushrooms, or... boring old trees? A religion built on the deception of the masses by three mortals-turned-gods, the corruption of an entire race of elves by a demon god, a mad mortal-turned-god who lives in a fucking *volcano* corrupting an army of minions via nightmares and magic cancer and rebuilding a gigantic robot with the heart of a dead god to conquer the continent, or the totally original idea of... dragons?

&gt;The fog was just their to hide how repetitive and small the world actually was.

The fog was a limitation of the game engine. You can remove it with graphics mods, revealing that Morrowind has the most visually diverse game world of all the Elder Scrolls games.

&gt;in depth lore hidden in the smallest places.

This started with Morrowind. Not only the hundreds of books, the thousands of lines of dialog (which I admit gets pretty cumbersome pretty quick), but also the Bethesda tradition of telling stories through item placement.

6368	"I seems your mind is already made up. This isn't about truly changing your view, it would take an inherent change in yourself for that to happen. In other words, unless someone here knew you personally, it is *impossible* to change your view. It seems more like you're here to profess your belief and defend it.

&gt; You expect me to believe girls are so stupid that they do not know our motive when we offer them alcohol or to drink with us at parties?

That's confrontational right there. I didn't argue anything, nobody did, for you to say we expect you to believe anything. This statement is premature and preemptive. 

&gt; Coaxing may sound like a bad word to many of you out there, but it means the same thing to me as flirting or ""grooming.

That is a false statement, I may at least manage to argue this point. By Oxford dictionaries, flirting is to behave as if you are sexually attracted to someone, coaxing is broader, it means to persuade someone to do something. So no, they are not the same thing. They're not mutually exclusive, but they're not the same either. 

&gt; Now I am not a bad person whatsoever, i say this as what i say next probably seems awful , but in all honesty these girls we fuck at parties mean next to nothing to us

These two seem to be mutually exclusive. You admit that it sounds awful, so what makes you think you're not a bad person. It seems more like you're trying to 'convince' yourself you're not a bad person rather than actually making a statement of fact or true resolve. 

&gt; their mental well-being is hardly my concern. 

Another problem. If their well being is not your concern, it seems you have a totally different set of morals than others. How is anyone supposed to change your view? You can't change a no into a yes without a maybe, and you've shown no uncertainty in your resolve for that to be a possibility. Seems more like a challenge than a true intention to have your view changed. 

But I'll indulge: Let's say a pedophile sexually assaults a small boy/girl. We generally look down on this cause 1) the child is innocent and young 2) they will be traumatized. Now, bare with me, if mentally manipulating under influence of alcohol is ok regardless of what the mental wellbeing of the girl is, then what's stopping you from mentally manipulating a child with a piece of candy regardless of his or her wellbeing? If one doesn't matter, why not the other? How far do you go with this? Because these two scenarios are now exactly the same thing. 

And let's not deny what this is. We all know what alcohol does. It loosens your mental inhibitions. So, you are definitely mentally manipulating a girl to have sex with you for your own personal pleasure. The sex is not consensual in the slightest. It's not rape, but it's not consensual either. You're toeing a line of legality here, a line that if crossed, you may well find yourself trying to defend these actions before a judge for the same reason Bill Cosby has to now. 

&gt; it is a thing at my school for guys to get a hold of drugs that ""enhance sexual appetite"" such as extasy or MD, and offer to share it with girls at parties in order to have sex with them and hookup.

Wtf? So, we're definitely going down the line of drugging girls to have sex with you. That's not just nonconsensual, that's outright illegal and adds to the comparison to Bill Cosby who did exactly the same thing. What sort of a school is this? 

&gt; Once again I see nothing wrong with this. Cmv

I'll try, I really will. But before I do, I need to know if it's possible. Are you seriously willing to change something inherent to yourself? And if you do, are you ready to come to terms with something very seriously wrong you do/did? Or are you simply challenging us to argue the morality of nonconsensual, drugged sex? Either way, trying to change your view seems like a very tall order indeed. Something a therapist is likelier to do than a bunch of nameless, random people on reddit. But I'll try if I know it's possible. What points are you *uncertain* about? I can't break a now, but I change a maybe because there's fluidity there. A no never exists unless it is set in stone."

I'd be very surprised if we played Aminu at center for any length of time. He was already a little undersized at PF, playing the stretch 4 role.

IMO we'll probably start Dame/CJ/Hark/Aminu/Nurkic with at least one of Dame or CJ in the game almost the full 48 minutes, and Shabazz Napier supplementing them for about 15-20 mins a game. 

Crabbe plays the bulk of the non-cj/moe/aminu minutes at SG and SF. Guard rotations and positional flexibility allow for unconventional minute distributions among our wings, so Crabbe's minutes should rise from the 28 he's at closer to the mid 30s played by dame and cj. Pat Connaughton plays about 8-10 minutes a game.

Hark and Aminu revert to the same roles they held before we moved Turner and Vonleh to the starting lineup.

This is a tricky question to answer because the German adjustment to the creation of the GDR and its ruling SED party was multifaceted and varied considerably over time. What daily life was like was quite different for a GDR citizen in 1953, 1973, or 1983. Therefore it becomes very important when examining the GDR to distinguish between Germans' often begrudging acceptance of the status quo and embracing the SED's ideology of *Aufbau Sozialismus*(building socialism). The latter position always had some adherents among the wider public throughout the GDR's lifespan, but there was usually a distinct gap between rhetoric and reality that placed a hard ceiling on the SED's popularity and credibility. 

One element that forced compliance and adjustment was coercion by the state. The fact that the Soviet military occupation government (SVAG) kept a large contingent of troops in the Eastern zone certainly put a damper on any incipient resistance movement to the emergence of SED rule. Boots on the ground often meant that many Germans in the Easter zone had little choice but to accept post-1945 political realities. Systems of military justice almost invariably favored the occupier and underscored to Germans their subordinate place with the authorities. The SED's use of Soviet-supplied tanks to crush the 1953 uprisings also highlighted to many that at the end of the day, the state could, and would, use the barrel of a gun to survive. 

But coercion was only one component that enforced order within the nascent GDR. Co-option of existing political trends and sentiments was another strand in forming some degree of stability. SVAG's decision in June 1945 to allow the reestablishment of four political parties- the Communist Party (KPD), Socialist Party (SPD), the liberal democrats (LDP), Christian Democrats (CDU)- was a move that surprised many contemporaries at the time. Especially in the light of the Cold War and the later erection of single-party dictatorships within Eastern Europe, SVAG's move at first appears rather puzzling. However, there was a certain logic behind this decision. For one thing, Stalin believed that the Soviet European interests postwar would not be furthered by pursuing a strategy of revolutionary insurrection by a vanguard party, but rather through Communist Parties entering into political alliances with the left and co-opting the democratic system. Although SVAG clearly put its thumb on the scales to favor the SED (the forced amalgamation of the KPD and SPD), this strategy did buy a number of converts in the early postwar years. The war's ignominious end and the final agony of its last eighteen months had thoroughly discredited fascism in the eyes of many Germans and the political left held a great deal of attraction as alternatives to a brand of politics that left little but ashes. SED promises of a better future and an equitable standard of living was one that was enormously attractive in a time of real material dearth. Ironically, the SED's vision of a future of modern conveniences acquired through honest work (one of the hallmark slogans of the postwar period was ""work harder, earn more"") hearkened back to National Socialism's appeals to German workers that the the new order would reward the work of honest labor with modern amenities. Although the SED's promises of a socialist utopia foundered amidst Soviet reparations, bureaucratic incompetence and cronyism, as well as lofty expectations, it was an attractive script that had earlier found some resonance under Hitler. 

The enthusiasm felt by some for the *Aufbau* campaign helped the SED create its own cadres among German youth or those relatively uninvolved with National Socialism. The SED leadership, many of whom were KPD exiles from the 1930s, placed great stock in raising up a cadre of loyalists to prevent an internal coup. The cadre-building process often targeted young who may have grown up under Hitler, but whose youth meant their politics were relatively malleable, and much of the groundwork had already been laid by SVAG. Much of these programs sought to create a ""correct"" class structure by promoting or uplifting various individuals from the working classes into bourgeois professions. The *Neulehrer* program of SVAG was an example of this type of class-based affirmative action, with young Germans, often soldiers, gaining an official proletarian class-identity for being teachers of often ideological materials. Although the quality of *Neulehrer*teachers was often quite poor and the SED outlawed the term in 1952 because of its negative associations, many of the prominent SED members of the 1960s and 70s had cut their teeth within this program. Likewise, when the SED created its own secret police force, the MfS, it drew on young Germans so much that by 1952, over half of the MfS's members were under thirty. Positions that required a high-degree of training like physicians or professors often had to deal with the SED's carrot-and-stick approach to compliance. Professors in the early postwar period often had to follow strict lesson plans and were subject to termination based on their connections to the NSDAP. But while mass firings like Greifswald University in 1947 underscored state power, various perks like access to food and other amenities highlighted the benefits of loyalism. In the case of the Eastern zone's professoriate is an example of how quickly political orientations could turn, but also on what terms Germans could wring from the system. The professoriate, like much of German higher education, had been quite nazified and in the early years resisted SVAG's attempts to remodel German higher education along Stalinist lines.But there was shift in this tense relationship with the creation of the GDR because despite the SED's public campaign to cement Marxist-Leninist thought as the cornerstone of intellectual life, the SED tended to be more hands-off in the professoriate's actual academic life. Soviet intellectual and pedagogical models found relatively little traction in the GDR university beyond lip service, but the mandarins of the GDR academy were largely pliant servitors to the state. The GDR universities stayed largely quiet during events like the 1953 uprising despite the GDR professoriate's above average number of former NSDAP members (around 60% for the mid-1950s) than other professional groups.

Professionals like university professors often had the option of leaving for the FRG, which until the building of the Berlin Wall, remained a viable option for many in the GDR if conditions became too unbearable. Although the West posed the very real danger of a brain drain for an already tense socioeconomic situation, it did act as a safety-valve of sorts for the SED. *Republikﬂucht* and other forms of protest gave the GDR citizenry a weapon of sorts to use against the SED dictatorship. MfS reports on the wider population revealed widespread discontent with SED rule and a widespread belief in Party corruption. The 1953 Revolt also revealed fractures in the relationship of the SED to the ""friends"" in the USSR. Amidst the post-Stalin shuffling of power in Moscow, many within the USSR leadership saw the failure of Ulbricht's *Aufbau* campaign as a sign of SED incompetence and inability to manage its population. Although Moscow for reasons of Cold War politics could never throw the SED under the bus in exchange for a neutral united Germany under FRG leadership, the threat was always there in the minds of the SED leadership. The 1953 revolt shook many within the SED leadership to their core, the timing of the revolt meant that the Khrushchev found it expedient to blame it on Beria instead of Ulbricht, which many in the SED wanted the Soviets to do. Domestic unrest carried with it a further complications with the SED's patron, and this meant that the SED had to come up with a *modus vivendi* of sorts with its population after the Wall's erection meant that malcontents could not pack up for the West. This gave *Eingaben* (direct petitions) to  SED officialdom a certain degree of heft that might be unexpected in a dictatorship. Participation in state elections, even if elections were the classic ""elections without choice"" that typify dictatorships, which hovered in the ninetieth percentile, gave many GDR citizens a chance to gain state resources in exchange for a public avowing of loyalty by showing up at the ballot box. Requests for state attention to fix a problem gained a degree more results during election season as the SED placed great priority in gaining high turnout as a means to legitimize itself in the eyes of the world, especially the FRG. 

Although Ulbricht remained in power, the Soviets pushed him towards easing up on the consumer economy and the resulting *Neues Ökonomisches System* (NES) sought to achieve prosperity through a rational management of the planned economy. The state eased production goals and gave more leeway for factory management and the promotion of a technocratic elite. The NES was in line with the wider Eastern bloc's post-Stalin economic system during the Khrushchev era (Vera Dunham's ""Big Deal"") in which Communist party rule did not promise a Utopian restructuring of society, but rather a more palpable goal  of consumer goods and the good life. Leisure time increased during the 1960s as well as a modicum increase in the standard of living for the GDR society as a whole. Therefore, the GDR in the 1960s was a curious entity, a Stalinist style leadership presiding over a more liberalized economy.

Compare the first nations people of the West Coast to those of Central Canada and Ontario, you'll see that they were never defeated, even if you want to use your definition. Also, it's definitely not a meme.  We took the cultural of a small group of people and threw it into a melting pot, to overuse the analogy.  This integration is not defeat in the traditional sense.

Also, to my knowledge the Government of Canada has never fought a war against First Nations people.  Are you thinking of the Indian Wars in the United States maybe? The closest we got was the Red River Rebellion, when the Metis people of the Red River Colony fought for their rights as individuals.  That lead to a handful of deaths and the quashing of the rebellion and the creation of a Martyr that is still celebrated in Manitoba.

Yeah of course AGOT-ASOS feel like every line meant something because you saw the pay offs for most of those lines in ASOS. You haven't seen the full pay off for AFFC-ADWD until TWOW hits. 

1) Young Griff is there to change the context of Dany's invasion or else it'd be like the show where everyone joins up with her and then you'd have more criticism on how she she gets everything handed to her. 

2) There is no Penny arc. She's a minor character that's there for a few chapters for Tyrion to bond with and then probably kill pushing him farther into the villainous path he's walking on.

3) Quentyn's story is there to turn Dorne against Daenerys, deconstruct adventure, show us the Battle at Astapor, fill out Volantis, put the Tattered Prince in Dany's camp and release the dragons so are Greyjoys can capture them. That's quite a bit for 4 chapters.

4) The story of Dorne isn't over. It connects directly to Young Griff's story (King Aegon and Queen Arianne), puts the SS in KL to possibly murder Tommen or more, and might connect to the plot at Oldtown with Obara, Darkstar, Areo Hotah and Balon Swann heading west.

5) Dany and Tyrion haven't met because Dany has to take care of a few things like binding the Dothraki to her cause and Tyrion has to prove himself. The circumstances of their meeting are going to be vastly different.

6) I think the show version of Tyrion's story post-Tywin is one of the most awful things to have happened. He's a complete Gary Stu with barely any character anymore. He's a caricature of the real Tyrion. He'll even the author has a problem with how they've portrayed him. Even in season 6 he has like 5 scenes where he fucks up but the story glosses it over like it's a good thing and he's named Hand of the Queen. Why? He didn't earn it. He messed up Meereen up.

What people don't understand is this is a very very old tradition in america that predates television. They don't recognize it because the scale is so different, and the elements of the tradition have gradually mutated. But your job isn't really to ""fight a guy into a submissive position"" it's to ""Make the audience throw quarters in the ring"". 

And the way you do that is still the same, you use theatrical skills and athleticism to tell a story. 

It's kinda funny cause, the wrestling isn't real, the stories aren't that good. But it persists and it's really hard to understand why. But if you steep yourself in it for a bit, you can see it's got an appeal that's similar to comics, mythology and sports. Not necessarily the most... well... *you know*. you know? But it is an option for a niche to fill that is filled by LOTS of other stuff people do as well. 

There are lots of other interesting things about it, like the fact that it's a gigantic weekly production, the fact that for a lot of people it's a father son tradition, the economics of it, the biographical stories contained within.

6696	"I would say that the creating of new/widening highways is pretty much necessary when you have a large metropolitan area. Sometimes people need to travel quite a distance to get to work, simply because public transit would be too expensive to effectively service them. This can also be dependent on the housing prices in certain areas as well.

For example, I'm from the Greater Toronto Area. Toronto is a huge hub for cities all around it. A massive amount of jobs are located in Toronto, but a lot of people can't afford to live in Toronto due to housing prices inflating. The suburb communities around it like Mississauga are too expensive as well, so people settle to live in further away areas like Vaughan, Hamilton, Burlington, Guelph, Peterborough, etc. These cities are rather far (30-45 minutes drive without traffic) and don't have as many professional jobs, so everyone uses highway 401 or highway 403 to commute to Toronto, and it can get packed.

Even getting to or from some close satellite cities can be difficult, usually requiring a car or bus ride to the nearest subway station, and can take longer, so people will often opt to drive. It's just how it is. It's hard and costly to get a huge and efficient public transport network going across a massive metropolitan area, so continually widening highways is often the only option."

6754	"&gt; Agreed. I just don't see how many of the world's governments would willingly and peacefully allow this to happen, especially those that are fully owned by corporations right now.

I disagree; from a profit-optimizing standpoint, automation is favored by the corporations in the long run. Hell, with the way the minimum wage is going I'd dare say that long run might turn to short very soon.

As for your thirds, the first part is easy, agreed. Second part is sort of hard, though if you mass scale the automation the cost of machinery would be reduced significantly which would increase profits anyway. All you'd have to do is take a chunk of the difference between current operations and those operations and divert it into taxation. Wrong or right, there's a whole bunch of numbers you can play around to find the middle ground.

Last third is the problem. How do you stop people from choosing crime due to boredom? How do you introduce a system which assumes we all get the benefits of mankind's progress if it doesn't make me get ""more equal"" benefits than you? As usual, humans are the problem of our model.

6755	"Agreed! It makes little sense.

In the UK, our car tax is based off CO2 emissions. It's a banded system.

I.e. low CO2 is encouraged - which is how I think it *should* be.

However, there are some new petrol cars that have some *fantastic* CO2 emissions and really good MPG.

E.g. http://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/seat/ibiza/10-ecotsi-110-fr-5dr-dsg/first-drive

The 94bhp version does 68 MPG (56 MPG US) and only 94g/KM of CO2!

The slightly mor involved, but much more robust method would be to actually reinforce the door panels.
I'd probably measure the panels and buy a sheet of 1/8"" birch plywood, have them cut it for you at Home Depot or wherever, if you don't have a tablesaw. Then remove the pins on the door hinges, lay the door on a flat bench or floor, scuff up the worst side of the panels, scratch them up really good, and use some yellow wood glue all over the back of the new panels, place them down, and put some weights on top to hold the new panels down tightly. Then 24 hrs later, you have a new, sturdy surface to prep and paint. Caulk or fill the edges prior to paint, and nobody will ever suspect there's been a repair. If that's not improvement enough, reinforce both sides of the panels. (That's probably overkill though)

Many of those problems we only really understand after experimentation we've done on board the ISS.

What's more, technological progression isn't guaranteed. The only field we've substantially improved in compared to the Apollo era is in computing, and you don't really need that much computing power on a spaceship. Materials science has only progressed incrementally, and we've pretty much hit the peak of what can be done with chemical propulsion. For the most part, a spacecraft today uses mostly the same technologies we would have had in 1970.

NASA had limited amounts of time and budget. They had to make choices on what to spend it on. They decided that trying to make LEO flight cheaper and more accessible had greater potential rewards than a manned Martian mission, especially with improving robotic exploration. 

If you want to blame someone, blame Nixon. Nixon was the one who made big cuts to NASA's budget. Those cuts forced NASA to change their plans for a large fully reusable SSTO spaceplane that took off horizontally to ones for a spaceplane that took off vertically that needed a new fuel tank every time. NASA's original plan for the shuttle was more expensive to build but much cheaper to run, and was envisioned having a launch every couple weeks. "	FALSE

What a scary and ignorant comment. Fact is, over many many decades worth of statistics, it shows that the poorer people are the more children they get. The richer people are the less children they get. Currently we dont get enough children in the western world(2.1 at a minimum), while the poorest people in the world get a whole lot of kids.

7029	"Does this kind of logic actually help get our message across? It isn't really possible to put strict boundaries defining what black is either, and the average person won't listen to this argument that there is no white race because it seems to fly in the face of reality. Labeling an individual as White or Black has meant different things to different people at different times. White people are a race because they and others imagine themselves to be one, just as black people are a race because others, then themselves came to see themselves as such. The problem with Race is that even though it is not real in a physical sense, once we imagine it, it does become real in our minds, just like any other imagined community. It is then reinforced by the different experiences and inequality between these communities.

On the whole, I understand your point and mostly agree. White nationalism means exactly what the guy shouting about it imagines it to mean. But if he organises a community of people who imagine themselves as White as their primary identifier, that's what they become, especially if they have a dominant position within the state. 

I had this exact argument with a friend back when I was much more liberal. Funnily enough its the conversation that started me down the path of more seriously considering socialism. But I don't think most people would have my reaction. I was a polisci student that had already been exposed to some marxist thought, was quite a socially liberal liberal, and was particularly interested in the concept of nationalism as an imagined community.But most people have exactly zero interest in politics, never mind political theory. And further, it took me a long time to really understand the point my friend and now you are making. Yes, white skin is not what makes someone White, and and the definition has varied over time. It is the fact that there are a great many people that are imagined as being white, just as we imagine the French to be French. Any nationalism is an imagined division between humans that does not actually exist in nature or biology. But White people imagine themselves to be White, and others imagine them to be White, and that makes them White. Sure you can just boil it all down and say 'Race is stupid and is so amorphous as to not exist', and I'd agree with you. But I don't think it helps end Race and racism. The white working class is starting to identify as capital-W White in ways perhaps never before seen. Insisting that White isn't a race will be as successful as insisting America is not a nation. You'll convince a few who really think about it, but to the rest you are just spouting inflammatory nonsense, and they tune you out. People need to be baby'd through the concepts of societal constructs and imagined communities. They sure as shit aren't learning about them in school, so assuming the average person will have the background knowledge necessary to understand why you are correct is not a recipe for success in my opinion.

TL;DR Brevity is not my strong suit. I don't think insisting there is no White race will work, even if its true. All races and nations are imagined divisions. People with white skin are identifying as capital-W White in ways that we have not seen in decades. It makes their nationalism as real and dangerous as any nationalism. We have to be more clearly articulating that all nations and races are imagined social constructs, because the average person genuinely does not understand this, and explaining how imagined communities come to exist is a hell of a lot more effective than a off-handed 'not real'."

7032	"I see some of the people are confused about why Erdogan has the majority of the Turkish people on his side, including a great deal of non-religious and liberals backing him up.

What you should know about Turkey's President, Recap Tayyip Erdogan:

1. The Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita.

2. Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey's debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey.

3. In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia.

4. In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan's leadership. Inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004.

5. Under Erdoğan's government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50.

6. Between 2002 and 2011, another 13500 km of expressway were built.

7. For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country's high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1076 km of railway were built and 5449 km of railway renewed.

8. Erdogan put greater investments into the healthcare system than any predecessor. As part of the reforms, the ""Green Card"" program, which provides free health benefits to the poor.

9. Erdoğan increased Education spending from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry and number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

10. In 1996 1$=222 Lira and in 2016  1$=2.94 Lira, even after the recent turmoil."	FALSE

7034	Basic thing to take from all this is --- don't force women to wear or not-wear certain pieces of clothing. If women don't want to wear hijab, they shouldn't have to. And if women DO want to wear hijab, they should be able to. 	FALSE

7036	"You're gonna throw it out ANYWAY. In response to your previous query, it is the fault of capitalism because capitalism is a profit oriented system - that extra food could have been sold for money, but giving it away, you could give some twisted, fucked up reasoning like ""oh if we donate this food, soon people won't buy it anymore and just wait for us to throw it out!"" Same bullshit reasoning behind not having welfare - if the state gives people ""free money"" they won't have any incentive to work. Some people would rather burn the whole thing to the ground than be forced to share. 

I'm like, even from a liberal perspective, I have a fucking job, why would I live off scraps from the state if I get paid a decent salary, which used to be the case for quite a lot of people who disagreed with the concept of welfare. In this example, why would I waste time going to a food bank/soup kitchen/charity or wherever this extra food would ultimately be donated when I could just pay for lunch and be on my way?

From a socialist perspective, I don't think any organization, business or entity should be run for profit, I think people should be provided what they need by their society and if it's the case that we have an abundance of goods because we've become just so efficient and growing and producing things, then it really shouldn't be a big deal to provide it to people even if that means SOME folks won't be able to make a buck off of it.

I work in events and hospitality as a manager and whenever my company runs functions I always try to ensure, to the best of my ability, that all my staff get a bite to eat from the caterers, since we pretty much always have more than enough (better to have too much than too little when it comes to functions), and most of the time everyone's cool with it. But I've literally heard from clients and even co-workers and higher ups trying to toady up to the client crap like ""these staff members didn't pay for it! I don't want to pay out of my pocket for these kids to be eating steak!"" I'm like, YOU ALREADY PAID FOR IT, you're gonna toss it, the party's over, and because you have a problem with a bunch of young folks daring to eat this gourmet, high class shit, you're just gonna act spiteful? Thankfully that isn't very often, and sometimes people will even be cool with taking unused alcohol home (rare) but it really, really pisses me off when that happens.

If they don't know what they're doing, then they aren't criminally culpable (for crimes that include a *mens rea* element, anyway, which most of the big ""evil"" crimes absolutely do).

The way you're describing it makes it impossible to prosecute anyone for a crime.

""I cared more about stealing that sweet $10,000 TV than I did about getting caught, therefore I'm insane.""

""I cared more about getting to work faster than I did that the speed limit was 55, therefore I'm insane""

Are both *valid defenses* now that you've added in this perversion of *mens rea* and you've basically destroyed the entirety of criminal law.

By Bryan Appleyard

&gt;RELIGIOUS fundamentalists frequently inspire mockery or fear in the secular-minded for their reliance on faith and rejection of reason. In response, the fundamentalists argue that secularism is underpinned by a faith or world view far more groundless or arbitrary than their own. That faith may be said to be liberalism, democracy or progress, but, most commonly and most correctly, it is identified as science.

&gt;**Science is indeed the faith**, system, theory, methodology – choose your own term – that sustains liberal democratic secularism.

7235	I wouldn't worry about size limitations regarding the size of the card. Any full size tower should fit the GTX 1080 or  1070 just fine. Compatibility wise, you would have to get new power cables as the 760 uses 2 6-pins, while the 1070 and 1080 both use a single 8-pin, though that may vary in some of the third party vendors. Which card you should get depends on what resolution you are playing at. The 1080 is the only GPU out there that can feasibly play games at maximum settings and 4k, while the 1070 is a great choice for a 1440p setup. If you are playing on a 1080p monitor, either card will be overkill, and in that case I would recommend waiting until Polaris comes out. 	FALSE

7250	"The case for the resurrection is very strong; it's not airtight as Jesus' life &amp; crucifixion, but it's such a strong case that it would take more ""faith"" to remain an atheist and deny it. The three main points for the resurrection as the only available explanation for everything which occurred:

2a) Empty Tomb, Missing Body, Lack of Jewish &amp; Roman Rebuttals - Christianity could have been stopped in its tracks then &amp; there in Jerusalem where Jesus was crucified. All the Romans or the Jews had to do was go to the tomb, produce Jesus' body and immediately prove that Jesus was still dead and the Christians were lying about his resurrection. It would have been impossible for Christianity to continue to grow in Jerusalem while preaching the resurrection of Jesus if his body was still in the tomb. That his body was never produced by the Romans or the Jews indicates that the body was missing. Instead, the earliest known Jewish argument was that Jesus' body had somehow been stolen by the disciples when the guards had fallen asleep. The stolen body argument is illustrated in multiple early sources including:

    Justin Martyr (100-165 AD), Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 108,
    Tertullian (155-240 AD), De Spectaculis (~ 197-202 AD), Chapter 30.

The stolen body theory also fails to explain what happened after the resurrection; disciples who doubted Jesus and denied him such as Peter and James (brother of Jesus), become ardent preachers of the faith and would later be martyred for it. If they had actually stolen the body and knew the resurrection of Jesus was a lie, how could this inspire them to such new levels of piety that they would go from denying Jesus to being martyred in his name?

Another interesting point is that in the NT women discover the tomb is empty. In historical Jewish society women had a lower status than men, particularly in their ability to serve as legal witnesses. If the goal of the NT writers was to convince by deception instead of telling the truth, it makes no sense for them to have written that women found the empty tomb - the only reason they'd write that is if it actually happened that way. An example of the status of women in those times is found in Antiquities 4.8.15 by Flavius Josephus (~ 37-100 AD):

""[219] But let not a single witness be credited, but three, or two at the least, and those such whose testimony is confirmed by their good lives. But let not the testimony of women be admitted, on account of the levity and boldness of their sex. Nor let servants be admitted to give testimony, on account of the ignobility of their soul; since it is probable that they may not speak truth, either out of hope of gain, or fear of punishment. But if any one be believed to have borne false witness, let him, when he is convicted, suffer all the very same punishments which he against whom he bore witness was to have suffered.""

Finally the NT gospel of Mark which many scholars agree is the earliest of the 4 major Gospels (and that later Gospels such as Matthew were based on) tells us in 15:42-47:

""It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.""

Joseph of Arimathea was a ""prominent member"" of the Jewish Sanhedrein, a Jewish Court - he was a well-known member of the ruling class. If the claim that he buried Jesus in the earliest Gospel of Mark was a work of fiction, it would have exposed the earliest Christians as frauds and provided a trivial rebuttal for the Jews who were hostile to Jesus &amp; the resurrection. Instead all of the evidence we have shows the Jews persisted with the stolen body theory. As Jesus was buried by a well-known member of their own ruling class, the Jews knew where Jesus was buried; if his body was still there, all they had to do was go to the tomb and show it to the world. NT scholars almost universally hold that the tomb was in fact empty, and atheist scholars who reject the resurrection have no credible explanation for the missing body."	FALSE

So much so that the theory goes if you dropped said critical mass of strangelets into a star you'd sterilise the system as a minimum and doom the galaxy as a maximum if further critical bundles of strangelets get cast out.

Most have been archived, though, so you can't followup there.  So this is not to discourage further questions, rebuttals, or points.

* [In ""Band of Brothers"", we see a German soldier who is, in fact, an American who went to join the war for Germany in 1941.

* [In Band of Brothers, there is a German soldier born and raised in Oregon, but is serving in the Nazi military because his family ""answered the Aryan call,"" or something along those lines.

I think a majority of people on reddit would consider themselves irreligious, but don't consider atheism part of their identity. Atheism as an identity is more about hating religious people, having a superficial interest in STEMS subjects and enjoying video games than it is about actual religious and philosophical positions. People are tired of it. It's easy to bash on religion on reddit and you used to get tons of praise for it. If you bring intelligent discussion and some understand of religious beliefs you probably won't get criticised. But if you just shit on religion and bring your Sunday asleep at church service level of knowledge to the discussion then you're really not adding anything worthwhile. So you deservedly get criticised for it.

7347	"It is generally well known that [tariffs result in dead-weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff#Economic_analysis). What this means is that the total monetary gains from trade are greater than the total losses.

As [Steven Landsburg argues:](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/opinion/16landsburg.html?ex=1358226000&amp;en=f9b3588d04dc0784&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all)
&gt;All economists know that when American jobs are outsourced, Americans as a group are net winners. What we lose through lower wages is more than offset by what we gain through lower prices. In other words, the winners can more than afford to compensate the losers. 

What he suggests here is that compensating the losers of free trade is a viable strategy. What a policy like this means is that people who would be worse off with free trade get compensated by people better off- effectively making *everyone* better off. 

[The economist agrees with this position:](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21695855-americas-economy-benefits-hugely-trade-its-costs-have-been-amplified-policy)

&gt;To the extent that some Americans are harmed, which is inevitable, the projected gains of future free-trade agreements should be more than enough to compensate losers, if only the government can get itself organised.

The economist also suggests that governments have not adequately compensated losers of trade in the past, which would explain the dislike of free trade in many parts of America. 

These articles suggest that sufficiently compensating losers of free trade is better for *everyone* compared to a tariff."	FALSE

7388	"&gt; 1. Is this sub pro-government because they're the lesser of two evils? 

Yes, I'd say so. Assad is a brutal dictator and imo he has to go after stability has returned but the social aspect is the deciding factor for me. Assad is relatively secular. Shia, Sunni, Alawites, Druze and Christians all were respected in their beliefs and women weren't forced into burkas and stuff like that. 

Also I can not stand that the rebels tolerate and fight with Al-Nusra - the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda - even if it's just out of necessity.

&gt; 2. In terms of percentage, how much territory is still rebel controlled vs. government controlled. 

Let's just look at the rebels: They have two major regions under their control: The whole Idlib Governorate plus the Western countryside of Aleppo and large parts of the Daraa Governorate. 

In addition to that there are several enclaves. The important ones would be East Ghouta which includes the city of Douma, the so called Azaz pocket north of Aleppo, the Rastan pocket north of Homs and a large desert part from Dumayr to the Tanf border crossing. Also several single towns are (partially) under rebel control. For example Madaya, Darayya, Zabadani and most importantly the Eastern half of Aleppo which got encircled recently. 


Here is a simple relatively well updated map: https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1OSttyvbGKqntDjF8Q0vfHCHUZo4 

&gt; 3. How much influence does Russia have in this conflict? Are there any Russian-affiliated troops on the ground?

Some Russian Special Forces are on the ground. Russia definitely changed the game when they started their airstrikes. Before that the rebels just had taken cities like Idlib and Jisr al-Shugur but when Mother Russia entered the game they dropped some AWPs and started a B rush resulting in breaking the sieges of Nubl and Kuwayres, a large South Aleppo offensive, big gains in East Ghouta, the capture of Sheikh Miskin in Daraa countryside and so on. 

&gt; 4. Does the change in Turkey's situation following the ""coup"" have any significant impact in Syria?

The support of Turkey was declining before that but right now you can feel that Erdogan is more focused on his purge than on Syria. Thousands of his proxy forces just got encircled in Aleppo and there is 0 response.

The value of a good isn't the maker's labor time, but the average time necessary to create an object by society (what Marx calls ""societally necessary labor time). The faster it can be produced (on average, societally) the lower the value. In fact, if you are incapable of producing a good at the average production time, you are a less desired worker because you can't produce the desired quantity for exchange. A capitalist must increase production, thus lowering value, in an effort to outcompete other capitalists (who themselves produce more so they can lower prices). Over time, their competition effectively destroys the value, price, and profit of a good.

But the Iraq War wasn't exactly good for armor either. An undisclosed (you can probably guess why) number of tanks were destroyed in Iraq, I remember reading about 530 Abrams had been damaged enough by some time in 2006 that they had to be shipped to Anniston Army Depot to be repaired (or scrapped) as the repairs were too heavy to be done at the bases in Iraq and Kuwait. I would like to check out the armor graveyards in Iraq some day, but they're kinda out in the middle of nowhere.

I became a fan of the T-90 after seeing Syrian T-90 take TOW-2A shots and just driving on its own back to base for repairs. And the Syrian army has pretty poor armored tactics too. Meanwhile Iraq's armor inventory is getting shredded, and after their limited M1's is an even further limited number of T-72M's (a crap export version of the T-72A. Thanks USSR!) and T-55's... oh boy.

There was a potential for Britain to starve to death and then later its husk would still be useful by the US for staging attacks on Europe, realistically there was no risk of Britain being invaded by the Germans at that time.

The missile originated in the Pentagon driveway area and only had to cross the lawn. That's why 'witnesses' were describing many different events instead of the same one. They only saw a flash and it was over.

The first 911 phone report said a helicopter had gone around the Pentagon and fired a missile at it.  That makes a lot of sense considering the forensic evidence I found to support it.

7595	"I work with robots, specifically robotic arms mounted to a surface. Basically what you've got is a blind, deaf and dumb machine you can set some joint values on and the arm moves. Throw some software at it and you can go to some coordinate and avoid colliding with yourself or the floor. That's mostly state-of-the-art for industrial robotics because it works well for doing repetitive tasks.

Robots in space, especially rovers, need to operate in a changing environment, with imperfect knowledge, without maintenance and in the absense of immediate human supervision. In order to operate an arm like on the Curiosity rover, you need to add a lot of cameras and sensors. Every one of those adds a lot of complexity to you system. Computer vision is still a hard problem, especially when you're trying to recognize a red rock among other red rocks. When operating on a surface, for example with a drill, you can use collision sensors to find out when you're touching the rock. You can't get more information by ""feeling"" it, like a human would, since you only have a few measuring points. In general the robot's body lacks sensory feedback, so it's easy to damage it. And now you've got the problem of repair: Humans can easily heal small cuts and intuitively work around major stuff like fractures. Robots can only degrade and engineers have to figure out how to handle an injury. Even if we get better in the sensory department, I don't see us building self-healing robots anytime soon.

Also the machine is at a big disadvantage when it comes to thinking about problems. A human can quickly improvise a hammer from a rock and bash a nail into a hole through which air is escaping. The machine will probably have an issue with even gripping the stone, if it's not ideally shaped or lies in an awkward position. General problem solving is completely out of scope for autonomous systems. In general, machines cannot conceptualize. Current-day machine learning is mostly focussed around distinguishing objects of type A from type B, or recognizing that some N objects A are currently in view. If you know that you can apply some canned strategy to that object, like driving around a rock. However, if the machine encounters something completely new it can't even recognize that: If the rover knows many different solid rocks and suddenly sees an arch, that may be recognized as none, one or two solid rocks. All behaviour towards it will be in the context of what it knows about solid rocks, e.g. ""drive around it"". It cannot ever ""get the idea"" of driving through it. That's a cognitive leap only humans can do right now. Humans can also experiment. Can I walk though this solid rock? Yes? it must be something new! What happens when I throw a stone through it? And so on. Again, the machine cannot experiment, because we don't really know how to make it 1) notice that soemthing is new 2) creatively find ways to interact with the new thing and 3) autonomously formulate what the new thing is.

7622	When I was younger we had a koi fish pond in our backyard. Every once in awhile when we went outside you would see a raccoon scurry off the pond trying to have a koi fish snack. One night my brother went outside and suddenly bolted back in telling us about a raccoon stuck in the chain link fence. We all went to check it out. Anytime we got near it, it started hissing wildly and snapping at us. It was full grown and it's head was very stuck through the chain link. I'm sure anyone trying to push it through would have lost a finger. My dad grabbed a broom stick and was trying to push its head back through. Finally we got it free and it took off but the end of that broom stick was completely splintered from that thing chomping down on it.  We hoped there wasn't a baby somewhere on our side of the fence that it was willing to rip our faces off to get to.  Luckily it took off in the other direction, that thing was fucking ruthless.

Basically, existentialism advocates for the creation of your own meaning. Camus on the other hand thinks that there is no meaning (Mankind is searching for meaning in a world that doesn't provide any) and you should just put up with it.

The next obvious reason why he isn't an existentialist is because he said so. There's literally a clear quote of him saying he was not an existentialism. It just baffles me that the guy defines clearly what he's not and yet people keep pinning him into the wrong box.

Another reason is that existentialism offers an individualistic approach. It's concerned with the human (no plural), the individual perspective. Camus' approach becomes much more collective by the end of his work, especially in his work about protesting and revolt (i.e: ""I'm protesting thus we are."")."	FALSE

Chicago was a real option, he would to have taken a 4 year max instead of 5. When LeBron went back to Cleveland he was able to get both a max contract and a contending team. Most free agents don't get both - similar to KD going to the Warriors it was more due to cap minutiae than anything else. 

Besides, comparing future contracts is disingenuous - LeBron has been taking 2 year deals to time his contracts with the cap spikes. Also, LeBron is the best player of all time. He makes a title team on his own - Melo does not. That needs to be factored into any sort of salary comparison. 

Anyways, it's not fair to say Melo is *only* in it for the money. NY wasn't absolute shit and had a conceivable path to the playoffs. But it was clear that NY was not going to be a contender while Melo was still at an all-star level, but he decided to stick around. He had other options. Btw, I don't think saying Melo choose money over contention is strictly a negative. I think it was a perfectly reasonable choice.

If he's in another state I'd look up the law around that as IIRC I think you can't file small claims interstate (I could be wrong).

For now, if he contacts you outside of PayPal, respond by copying his email into the resolution center and add your reply so it's all documented. 

Did your work contract have any clauses about disputes like this? Now would be a good time to research how to tighten up your agreements to protect you in the future. 

Again, don't stress. Follow through with PayPal. Most people making threats like this don't realize all the hassle filing paperwork is with the courts. He'd have to take time to go, file, gather documentation and so forth, pay court fees. Then take more time to show up. Likely that would cost him even more money. Hard to believe it would be worth it if PayPal already denies his claim.

7813	"I'm not from the US either - I'm Australian. It was customary in my country until fairly recently that wives took their husband's names and children took their father's, more or less as a matter of course. I believe that's the case in many countries with a historical connection to the British Empire, and it was very much the case historically in England. Now, many women choose to keep their name,  but many still take their husband's.

In my case, the decision was a practical one -I had had problems with a family member and it was to our advantage to change our names to be harder to find. If that had not been in play, I would have kept my name, and in practice, I actually use both. 

Edit: I forgot to address your main point. In places with this historical context, in cases where the mother kept her name, typically the child either still takes the father's, or gets a hyphenated name of both parents. It is not typical for a child of a married mother who kept her name to take just her name. I won't say it never happens, but it is not the norm. Typically the only time you see a child with the mother's surname is if she wasn't married when she had the child, and even then, oftenthe child will still have the father's name."	FALSE

Sadly Manchester has seen at increase to around 670 per 100,000.

It matters because generally resigning prohibits someone from unemployment but being fired doesn't, unless the employer also meets the relatively high burden of proof for cause. In this case, not a chance. The manager *forced her to quit,* not fire her, most likely his dumbsloshed brain was like ""hehehehehe, totally not gunna hafta pay unemployment cause she technically quit,"" the best kind of quitting for employees wanting to win UI claims.

7948	"I know, I had the same misconception too, and then I found out what trees are, and what wood is, and it all made sense.  The wood inside the tree is dead, but doesn't rot.  The living outer bark builds itself a tall wooden framework so it can get the leaves up high into the sun with a high surface area.

That wooden framework inside the bark would rot quickly if it wasn't preserved.  Bacteria, mold, insects and animals would eat the wood inside the tree.  So the sap has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal properties, as well as poisons to deter insects and animals, and the wood is infused with the sap as it is grown.  Of course these defenses vary depending on where the trees evolved, what they protected themselves against, etc..

But this becomes an interesting problem for professional woodworkers who deal with exotic hard woods, some of which are actually quite toxic, and can produce allergic responses from exposure to toxic dust in workshops.  This is especially bad with modern high speed tools, because they can produce a lot of micro-particle dust, so air filtration and exchange become important.  It can happen with any wood though, if the wood worker is unlucky with their personal degree of sensitivity.  My partner became allergic to oak, and it was a real show stopper for her ambition to go into furniture making, because oak is such a common hardwood in the industry.

But over in the kitchen, it turns out that wood is often very compatible with food, in spite of it seeming like it would be a porous nightmare for deadly bacteria to fester in."	FALSE

But, as far as I can tell, he did not voice his intentions and wants until sex started. He was in a position of power. You felt vulnerable and guilty (not to mention the physical power a man can have over a woman during intercourse) so you allowed him to treat you like this even though it made you feel emotionally distant and in some ways, disassociate from the sex act.

I recommend something like Rosa Luxemburg's ""Reform or Revolution?"" for an explanation of why there are revolutionary Marxists. In a nutshell, we can be certain that Capitalism will not last forever. But that doesn't mean that what comes next will be better.

Yes.  Single people *aren't* taxed significantly more than married couples.

8071	"&gt;And man are you underselling Antonio Brown. He has like 5/3 rds of the yards that Gronk had last season. His last 3 years stack up well with any 3 year stretch that Randy Moss had. Yeah he didn't have the immediate impact but the last 3 years he has been the best receiver in the league and he has not had the injury issues the other two have had.

How many TDs did Antonio Brown catch in the four games that Ben Roethlisberger didn't play last season?

&gt; And you are underselling Ward. His efficiency was really good and he arguably had his best seasons were before Roethlisberger.

Then it's just a function timing. Roethlisberger first became a high-volume passer in 2009, just as Hines Ward was beginning to decline.

&gt; Nate Washington, Heath Miller, Emmanuel Sanders, Mike Wallace, Randle El are all good receivers with 3 out of 4 having better seasons elsewhere or with a different QB before Roethlisberger.

Nate Washington was the third or fourth WR on the depth chart with the Steelers, so of course his production increased the moment he became a starter elsewhere, because he was getting more opportunities. And never mind that WR was listed as a position of need for the Titans virtually the entire time he was there.

Antwaan Randle El didn't even average 500 receiving yards per season for his career. His primary contribution was on special teams.

When people try to use Emmanuel Sanders' success with the Broncos against Roethlisberger, they seem to forget that Roethlisberger had the best season of his career right after Sanders left. They also forget that Sanders had his shot to be the man with the Steelers in 2013 but fucked it up. That's how Jerricho Cotchery ended up with 10 TDs that season, despite starting only six games.

Mike Wallace, like Santonio Holmes, has been irrelevant without Roethlisberger throwing him the ball.

Heath Miller was drafted in 2005 and retired just a few months ago, so the Roethlisberger-era Steelers are all he ever knew.

&gt; And lol at vastly inferior OL. Good Qbs make their OL look good. Take a look at the Pats OL when Brady isn't playing like in 08. Went from 4th in sack rate in 07 to 25th in 08 to 1st in 09.

Using that logic, Aaron Rodgers isn't that good of a QB, because he's been sacked at a higher rate since 2008 (6.9%) than Roethlisberger has (6.8%). But if you insist, Roethlisberger's sack rate was 5.1% in 2014 and 4.1% last season, and his sack rate hasn't been greater than or equal to 7.0% since 2011, so I guess he's making his offensive line look good after all."

8072	"Job Hunt
---

Met a redditor IRL because we both went to an assessment centre for this position. I managed to tactically inquire during the interview and there was only one position available (there was like 10 of us there), I didn't expect an excel test (no warning, not on job description) and I certainly didn't expect one where I couldn't use the help function. That other redditor's the only one I talked too who actually thought he did well on it, so all power to him. I'll be gracious in defeat.

Was offered an interview for a company down south. On the one hand I feel like beggars can't be choosers and I don't want to turn down this interview, on the otherhand, after a phone interview I still really don't feel I'm the right fit for the company, or that I want the position and I don't want to spend over 100 quid interviewing for a position I won't get and if I do get I won't want. So I've turned down the offer for an interview, but now I feel guilty about that.

A company turned me down for a grad scheme, but said they might offer me other opportunities and they'd be in touch. So dunno what's going to happen there.


Current Job

My shifts (well everyone's shifts) have been cut down because the students have gone home. I'm glad, I don't need the money that much, I was getting stressed and it'll allow me to concentrate on job hunting/procrastinating away from that.

Anime

As of writing, I'm now only majorly behind in one series that I'm watching this season, Yuri on Ice. Girlish Number has shot up to AOTS when I've been watching it. I'm genuinely surprised it has a low 7 MAL score, it can have quite an acerbic sense of humour so maybe that's it. I'm really hoping it jumps into at least mid 7 when it ends, I don't want it to be completely forgotten and unrecommended. 


Also trying to get my PTW a bit lower again, so I watched the Girls und Panzer film and I intend to watch some other films to get it down below 100. Binge watched Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru because I wanted to watch something trashy and lighthearted. It did the trick, but I can't say I recommend it. It especially dragged near the end there. Made some progress in attacking my CW which has gotten a little too crowded by watching some more Owari no Seraph which I intend to finish tonight.

8073	"One important factor when speaking about peak oil that hasn't made it in to this discussion yet (and there are several, but I don't have much time) is the concept of EROEI: energy returned on energy invested.  This is the ratio of how much energy it costs to extract, process, manufacture, and/or transport a given fuel source to the end user, relative to the amount of energy that fuel source provides.

When we first started extracting oil in the US, EROEI was incredibly high.  There are stories of people finding oil in their backyards and it literally bursting into the air like a geyser.  I don't know the exact number for EROEI of gasoline in the early 1900's, but I assume it was rather high.  By 1990, it was still 35:1 for oil imports to the US.

More recently, oil production has come from expensive offshore drilling platforms, remote and desolate locations, and intensive procedures like fracking.  The oil itself tends to be heavier and harder to process, as the cheap sweet, light crude (the best of the best) was the first to be exploited.  By 2007, EROEI for oil imports had dropped to 12:1.  Shale oil has a return of about 5:1.  For bitumen tar sands, it's much worse, about 3:1.

Alternative fuel sources like corn-based ethanol and biodiesel are much worse, about 1.3:1 for those, and 5:1 for sugarcane-based ethanol.  Hydro (100:1), wind (18:1), and geothermal (9.5-32.4:1) are much better, but are not ideal sources of energy for transportation, especially by sea or air.

Thus, reaching the peak of oil production (which probably has already occurred, but we can't be sure until decades after the fact) doesn't just mean that half of all oil in the world is gone, it means that what's left gives far less return on energy invested.   You're burning more fuel just to get the fuel you need to make more.

I just used this Wikipedia article as my source, apologies for that, but as I said I'm out of time!

**Can I file a harassment claim against a company that continues to send me emails after I have opted out of them numerous times?**
&gt;I receive emails from Twitter about 3 times a week even though I choose to opt-out of them every time I get one. Whenever I choose this, it takes me to a page that tells me I will stop receiving emails from them but I still continue to get them. I've tried to talk to them but it's led me nowhere. I have pictures showing that I've opted out of the emails and I was wondering if I could possibly file a harassment claim or anything of the like against them in order to finally get them to stop.

Now they figured how to trigger the failure which implies they have an understanding of how to not trigger the condition. So now their existing working design can work outside the previous limits of human knowledge because the fuzzy grey area is getting better defined.

Does writing help at all, while you write obituaries and letters to friends? I wonder if you've done any creative writing at all, such as putting these suicidal streams of thinking into creating a character that is fleshed out and put into story? You mentioned a very loose grasp of your childhood - is that something that could be explored or even completely invented in writing? 

Sorry if I am completely sidestepping the urgency of your feelings just now - I am taking in a completely selfish respect for your ability to describe your inner space. I hear that you're frustrated that it does you no good because I've felt that way too - that I've thought my way out of none of my problems, an expert in my head but useless in real life. But maybe if you have the ability to craft your words with such precision towards a harmful outcome, you might have the ability to craft a meaningful one. Would you take a class in creative writing with a good prof, or find a therapist that has experience guiding someone with creativity? 
Maybe you need a less literal creative approach to life, but need to completely shake up what you're used to experiencing. You need to change what is being put into your brain passively day to day. Have you moved or changed jobs recently? Done any traveling? Gone right out of your comfort zone and been on your own for more things? Is it possible that you know what might be best for you, but you're afraid of doing it?
You might need to take some small and large steps on your own (knowing that you can always ask for help and that it isn't weak to do so) before you really respect yourself. Not sure what you've accomplished in your life, or what kind of things you value, but there's something out there that you want to do that would prove to yourself that life is ok (at least some of the time.)

Biggest issue right now is an appropriate reactor doesn't exist.  The technology is out there in pieces but it needs specifically designed optimized for spacecraft.

8426	"Firstly, it's not an argument for Trump. It's simply telling you the facts and saying we don't want a rapist or someone legitimately accused of rape with a trail of evidence over 30 years in the White House, again. When stories with no evidence come out, (as have happened for Bill as well as Trump) it's easy to dismiss. With stories like Bill's more serious circumstances, that were documented before he was even president... For you to suggest that the first ever male spouse of the first ever female president holds absolutely no influence over the nation, is either disingenuous (which is deliberately pretending to be foolish) or it's just genuine foolishness, to naively believe something that is untrue because others have been constantly raising it as an empty argument against valid criticisms of Bill Clinton and his wife who aided him in the behavior and is currently running for the highest office, regardless of her own unrelated current globally corrupt scandals that have led to her reputation being beyond questionable. With her very appearance on debates, her temperament is laughable. This election isn't about Bill, and yet his involvement is influencing the public, and should she win, he will have the same degree of influence that Michelle Obama currently holds -- which is pretty fucking significant. Imagine if Michelle were an alleged rapist who once had to pay someone off over it (documented.) Would you be comfortable with her visiting schools? Speaking? Having direct input to the leader of the free world?  If Bill Clinton is insignificant, he needs to stay at home and stay on his couch and shut his mouth until he rots away. If he doesn't, he opens himself up to criticism as a public figure, and especially if he makes public appearances loudly supporting his wife who is running for a position that would lead to them both living in and having direct access to the consequences of our freedom.

It's funny how easily you try to dismiss a question about Bill being in power again as if it's just a reactionary response to criticism about Trump that we concurrently find invalid. The arguments are not related, especially not for all people. Meanwhile, you are doing the very same thing in instantly believing that Trump is a sexual predator when he has already begun the process of legal action against those who he with complete confidence knows lied about him to discredit him. If you think Juanita Broaddrick is a liar, that's up to you. I disagree, and her various witnesses who have seen Bill himself pull her out of a meeting to beg her for forgiveness disagree with you. I don't believe the women who all came out in the same week who went on to laugh and joke about being raped on TV shows as big time guests who when researched were found to also be employees and/or supporters of the Clinton campaign.

Read what Hillary does. She essentially makes a list of everything she is guilty of or what would incriminate her, and then she begins publicly accusing her opponent of it, complete with fabricated stories and paid actors."	FALSE

I have no opinion on the topic of this post, but this statement reflects a structural problem with moderatorship and Reddit. 

Admins don't have the power to lockout a crazed moderator?  Not to mention the lack of democracy &amp; accountability in mod membership.

It's a recipe for a poisoned tree when mods are appointed to permanent posts &amp; there is no mechanism for impeachment.

This is not an attack on AssuredlyAThrowAway.  It's a comment on his/her comment.  The clever firewall against impeachment of mods is a naked fatal flaw in Reddit.  And DOD's best friend.  But by the time Reddit recognizes this &amp; organizes a backlash, the damage will be long done."	FALSE

8436	"Societal ideas about sex, gender, and sexuality have set up an environment in which a lot of men think sex is for them and women think their role in sex is to please the man.

For example, society suggests that men have higher sex drives than women, implying that they want sex more. 

It suggests that it is easy to get a guy off, while, in contrast, it is difficult to bring a woman to orgasm or to please her; as a result, male-female couples sometimes focus more on--or exclusively on--the guy's orgasm or pleasure than the woman's. 

It suggests that the most important thing a woman can be is attractive, so many women are more concerned with *looking* sexy than *enjoying* sex.

All of these ideas create a toxic environment in which women, like your girlfriend, come to believe that it is normal for their male partners to not care about or pay attention to what they want. 

Expecting your girlfriend to feel as good as possible is not lame, it is how sex should be. Anything else is not sex, it is just a guy masturbating himself using a woman's body, like a human fleshlight.

Just for fun, let's work out a theoretical design.

A typical pacemaker battery, the BR2032, has 190 mAh of storage at 2.8V nominal. That's a pretty decent chunk of energy for low power wireless.

Assume operation in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, and assume antenna implantation directly under the skin to minimize tissue loss (perhaps the shoulder, like an actual pacemaker).

Neglecting the voltage droop as the battery goes near death (so just nominal voltage) yields about half a watt-hour of energy. Assume we want operation over five years before surgical replacement. That means we can use about one joule of energy per day.

We can work with that. Remember, this doesn't need to transmit continuously - a burst every 5 minutes is probably sufficient. The real magic here is that we don't need to send much data - probably just a unique identifier and a timestamp. Heck, let's throw in body temperature as well, just because we have it (this would tell us if the subject has removed the device with self-surgery).

The UID can probably be 8 bytes, the timestamp can be 4 bytes (UNIX time), and the temperature can be two bytes. That's a 14-byte payload, or 112 bits.

Before spreading, let's encode this as QPSK with a half-rate convolutional code, which will give us about a 5 dB Eb/N0 improvement over straight BPSK when decoded with a soft-decision Viterbi decoder (figure: http://i.imgur.com/BeIiybV.png).

Let's transmit at 9600 baud, so our transmission will take about 12 milliseconds and occupy an unspread bandwidth of about 9.6 kHz. Call it 15 kHz after pulse shaping.

At room temperature, Johnson noise power is -174 dBm/Hz. For a 15 kHz channel, that gives us a noise power of -132 dBm. Our 1E-5 point is about 4 dB Eb/N0. Converting to C/N in a 15 kHz channel gives as a required C/N of 3.2 dB. So, -132 dBm + 3.2 dB means that our detection threshold is about -129 dBm neglecting excess receiver noise.

Let's say we want to be able to pick this up from up to 3 km away in a metropolitan area (let's assume this is the max spacing on our PEDOTRACKER 9000^TM base stations). We can use the [COST Hata Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COST_Hata_model) as a rough approximation (it's only good up to 2 GHz but this will give us a 1st order estimate).

Substitute L = Ptx - Pthres into the model, where Pthres is the threshold sensitivity of -129 dBm. Let's assume a mobile station effective height of 1.5 meters and a base station height of 100m. Ptx then solves out to -0.7 dBm (let's call it 0 dBm).

The antenna is small and probably lossy, so let's assume -6 dBi gain. Knock off another -10 dBi from body losses. So, that gives us about -16 dBi on the antenna. 0 - (-16) = 16 dBm, so we need to transmit at 16 dBm.

In linear units, 16 dBm is 40 mW. Assuming a DC-to-RF efficiency of 50% means we need about 80 mW when we transmit.

Our 112 bits takes about 12 milliseconds to transmit. Let's add 5 milliseconds of preamble, and another 3 milliseconds for other stuff (microcontroller wakeup, PLL lock time, whatever else). This means we consume 80 mW for 20 ms = 1.6 mJ of energy consumption per transmission.

Transmitting every five minutes, we will burn through 0.46 Joules of energy per day. This is half of our energy budget, so it appears this will work. I think you could make this much tighter with some proper engineering optimization.

So yes, it seems feasible.

Someone's word is only worth something if it's valued, if you believe it's worth something.  The more often a Lannister pays his debts, the more his word is worth, because you have a belief that you'll be paid back.  So it's in their interest to repay you, and it's in their interest to remind you that they'll repay you.  

It doesn't always mean money.  They don't really have a concept of a life-debt in Westeros, but it's used by some members of the house to mean revenge.  If you attack a Lannister, they will repay you.

It's as true as you believe it is, basically.  Tywin worked very hard on his image and the image of his house.  He would have repaid every debt he could, though these days the Lannisters don't find themselves in debt much.  Tyrion does at times, and he makes it a marked point to repay.  See Mord, if you've gotten to the Vale yet.  Passing it to family members would be the same thing.  Nothing forces them to repay a family member's debt, but not doing so would weaken the house.

In the fish example, I absolutely believe that the 8th fish should be forced to pay if he has the option of leaving. You stay and pay for the shared defense, or you fend for yourself. 

It isn't fair to the other fish to be forced to associate with a freeloader. Why should they be forced to allow the 8th to stay? The 8th does not have the right to be there. 

Being grandfathered on land is a widely accepted concept. There is a house just down the street from us that is a historic farm that is exempted from taxes and zoning because it existed prior to the creation of the city. But, they were told if they wanted to connect to utilities they would void that status. You pay for what you use. 

I do believe that it is ""less evil"" to have a society that requires that its citizens pay taxes to protect common interests. This is because I believe it leads to the greatest satisfaction, technological progress, and least suffering overall. 

People are greedy. We have laws already to protect many people, but wherever they can, other people are taken advantage of. Child labor in fish factories. Illegal gold mines in Latin America where kids are missing mercury pools around. It is disgusting what people do to each other. You cannot deny that this is more common with lax laws, more corruption, etc. Where you see a stronger rule of law, and a stronger safety net, you have lower forced labor and a more satisfied populace.

You are arguing for less protection, which will lead to less satisfaction. Sure, if everyone followed your ideals of doing no harm, that might be great. But it is not realistic. It is not viable. And as much as I'd like to beat around the bush with you, thousands of years of history, by your own admission, have created exactly zero modern examples of an anarchist society. It is absolute dogma and naivete to believe that the next attempt will work.

8616	"You don't seem to understand the purpose of PEA. You think PEA is just this conglomerate of owners that want to make leagues and just give away money to the players. WRONG.

They are a group of businessmen with vested interest in controlling the NA ecosystem for a given title that their teams compete in. Control that will allow them to leverage their individual brands to negotiate exclusive broadcasting rights. That's what this is all about. Broadcasting rights is going to be one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for e-sports. The demographic is young and increasing in size every year. It's a gold-mine for advertisers. Big money is going to be poured into e-sports in the coming years because of it.

So, if you are PEA, you want to come in, offer these amazing prize pools in exchange for controlling who your ""competitors"" are. Sure, they said EPL is off the table today. But after that, a year from now, they can also say, hey, our teams won't compete in E-league anymore. All the while, dwindling any real competitor you have by forcing your teams to not compete in their events, which makes your league more valuable for advertisers as it will become the most watched league, thus allowing them to negotiate for even higher broadcasting rights. 

In theory, this would actually be a great option for pro players, as it would allow them to play less and make more money. Problem is, with how shady this all came about, and the person they put in charge (jason katz), the players probably feel like PEA is coming in, gutting their scene, giving them more money in the short term, sure, but will eventually have all the control and be able to dictate how much they give to the players...which will undoubtedly happen and will eventually force the players to create their own association in which they refuse to play until they come up with a CBA with the league.

8631	"You're assuming that gender is purely a societal construct. Most gender roles are the product of society, but men and women are biologically different. Some gender roles arise from these biological differences. Men (XY, to be perfectly clear) typically fit male gender roles, and women (XX) typically fit female gender roles. Bad things happen when gender is seen as totally binding on someone's personality, but gender stereotypes aren't entirely inaccurate. 

Women (XX) do tend to be more motherly, for instance. Not *all* women are motherly, but it's typically a safe assumption to make. When we assume wrong, it's embarrassing, but when people accept that mistakes will occasionally happen, stereotypes can be quite useful. Being able to assume certain things about strangers when we meet them can help introductions go more smoothly, and genders are very useful when understanding societal trends. Also, gender based marketing is *sometimes* a good idea. It can go horribly wrong, but it's not all bad. Giving maxi pads feminine brand names probably increases sales, as opposed to masculine names, like 9000-Series Vaginal Blood X-Orbers.

There really isn't much of one. A family member of mine worked for a law firm that was one of the biggest players in the HB1 space. These motherfuckers were more corrupt than Trump himself.

Literally the entire job of whole departments was what amounted to law breaking-falsifying all sorts of shit so that they could bring in a poor engineer from Bangladesh at $18/hr to do a job that loads of Americans were applying for daily-at the industry-standard rate of $50/hr. There was no labor shortage at all. There was only a shortage if you wanted to pay a PE engineer from MIT the same wage as a bartender with face tattoos and a GED.

This is what """"""""""""""""""labor shortages"""""""""""""""""""""""" look like in the USA. There is only a labor shortage for occupations where employers are looking to play the desperate, impoverished ""third world"" against workers whose companies are nominally required to conform to workplace discrimination, ethics, safety, etc. standards. How can we say that there is a labor shortage when entire departments are laid off after training their replacements-Were those employees not *already* doing the job?

It's the same way in manual labor fields. Then Taco Bell or Wendy's said that there is a shortage of Americans willing to pick their Tomatoes, what they meant was that there was a shortage of Americans willing to sleep 18-to-a-trailer in boiling heat with no showers or AC, and pick tomatoes for $3/hr under threat of deportation.

The whole thing is a sham, and the people involved are deeply evil. They have destroyed the lives and the future of hundreds of thousands of people (when you count the children of the people who are laid off or forced to work for vastly sub-standard wages, for the sole and express purpose of exploitation to enrich themselves and their benefactors.  

We need to have some pathway to immigration that forces everyone to play on the same terms, and that includes not giving privileges to people from desperate foreign nations who are willing to sell their health, family life, and dignity to pad the earnings of some huge multinational company (which is coercion; they are not at fault). Any company that is caught paying illegals below minimum wage, or claiming nobody applied for their position and going to an HB1 just because they wanted to save money over a fair wage, should be absolutely ripped to shreds by the court so that their legal and ethical competition can prosper.

This is not about legal vs. illegal immigrants, this is about every person in every field deserving the dignity of approximately the same wages and hiring prospects. "	FALSE

the '*' denotes engines that are lit. The exhaust would be stronger and would keep the high temperature compression shockwave farther away at the two outer engines that are part of the retropropulsive burn.

The inactive engines are denoted by 'o', and their covers might experience higher external temperatures, because the shockwave can get closer - especially during high-speed reentries.

a) the difference between the scientist and his assistant or anybody else is what they should be willing to bet in terms of money on the outcome of an experiment.

Thinking in terms of bets, one quickly sees that the Quantum Suicide machine can be seen as a mysterious money generating machine - for both parties. 

b) another way to resolve the problem is to contemplate the fate of a ""destroyed"" shirt. in the version of reality where the shirt is destroyed, it is only destroyed as a concept. that is, people in that world will agree that there is no shirt any longer, but in fact, whatever it was only transformed. the atoms it consist of evaporate, or in the worst case if it is annihilated, it is transformed into energy.

so yeah, we will agree that there is no longer a shirt, but so what? a shirt is a human concept.

why does this matter? because you can apply the same kind of thinking to consciousness. There are philosophical views of consciousness such as panpsychism in which an intrinsic aspect of consciousness is seen as imperishable. it is a nature of reality. we cannot conceive what consciousness without a brain is like - certainly it is not a thing that can think or remember or be angry, but according to these views there is an inconceivable sense in which it nevertheless is.

If we accept panpsychism as a possibility, then the intuition motivating the Quantum Suicide evaporates. I tried to explain this in more detail here: https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/57vy89/quantum_suicide_and_panpsychism/

8736	"No, Hitler and the Nazi's did not come to power because 'they did not bash the fash' enough. (I'm sort of sick of the wider reddit community using Askhistorians as a soapbox to ask questions that relate to how upset they are with the current situation in the world) But I digress.

In an incredibly general sense, the Nazi's rose to power because firstly, internally Germany was looking for their own guilty party as to who to blame for losing the first world war. The left within the Country would blame Imperialists and nationalists for ruining any chance of fair conciliation. The Right, in turn, would blame leftists, communists, and social democrats for accepting the treaty of Versailles to begin with –  calling them traitors to Germany. Regardless of any legitimate blame for either side, these back and forth accusations would crumble the integrity of democracy within the German state during the inter-war years. Secondly; It would create a diplomatic and political environment wherein a highly emotional populous could be manipulated by political entities using the pain of the Great War for a chance at power. Moreover, it created an environment where the populous would accept and support more drastic and extreme forms of leadership in the face of overwhelming hardship – both in practical terms (economic/political instability) and emotional (a beaten morale, a broken nation licking its war wounds and being picked apart by the International community

These more extreme and drastic forms of leadership obviously manifested itself in the form of Adolph Hitler, the architect of World War Two. Hitler’s rise, one could argue, was born out of the pain of the German nation during the inter-war years. While it would be more comforting to believe that he came to power illegitimately through illegal means, and not a lack of 'bashing the fash' Hitler’s rise was a mostly democratic one and truly a movement of the people. Could one truly blame the German public for putting their faith in a man, who, for all intents and purposes, truly loved Germany and its people? A man who spoke of Germany and its inhabitants as one would about a dear loved one? He was a charismatic leader who spat in the face of the ‘Victor’s peace’ and protected Germany from the vultures circling overhead. He promised to return the self-proclaimed ethnically superior Germany to it’s true glory at the top of European and World power. How could a German citizen, living in the middle of (until then) Germany’s darkest hour, resist such a temptation to get behind and support such a man? 

Hitler’s rhetoric captured the sense of betrayal the German people felt, not only to the Allies and International community, but to certain parts of internal German society as well. He squared the blame of losing the War on workers strikes, the signing of the Reichstag resolution (1917) and the Treaty of Versailles, which he called *“The enslavement of Germany itself”* . To Hitler, it was inconceivable that any blame rest at the feet of Germany for hostilities in World War One. Rather, the blame was squarely on people how had ‘stabbed Germany in the back ’ – Such as the Communists and Jews. It is arguably the environment caused by the Treaty of Versailles and the general turmoil of the Weimar Republic and Germany in general during the inter-war years that allowed these views to fester and generate ever more increasing popularity. As according to K. Schwabe, *“Actually, Hitler, in propagating his extremist views during the mid- twenties, belonged to the lunatic fringe on the right of Germany’s political spectrum ”* – But as history tells us, by the 1930’s the political void created by the effects political impotency in the face of the Treaty of Versailles and the Great Depression, he gained control of German Government and held a large amount of popularity amongst the German public. 

To truly understand the rise of Hitler I think it's best to examine an issue of Die Wehrmacht, a monthly German army magazine distributed during the war for propaganda purposes. According to Die Wehrmacht, the reason for Germany going to war in 1939 was essentially to fight the ‘old order’ of the world. A world in which Britain and her allies controlled the lion’s share of world power. One article writes *“The contrast between England itself and its overseas territories is so grotesque that England has always has a certain inferiority complex with respect to the European continent. Whenever a continental power reached a certain strength, England believed itself and its empire to be threatened ”* – Germany was essentially so powerful that England, threatened by Germany’s strength, was nervous that the old paradigm of unchallenged British power throughout the world was now in peril. The German argument, according to Die Wehrmacht, was that England was a hypocritical nation, pretending to defend liberty in one hand, but brutally subjugating its colonies and the people within them in another. An incredibly powerful quote within the text that speaks for itself perhaps answers the question as to the rationale for the psyche within Germany: *""We are fighting for our most valuable possession: our freedom [...] We are fighting so that our children will not be slaves of foreign rulers [...] We know the English. We know about Versailles, about the colonies England stole from us, about the Ruhr, about Golzheimer Heath, about the starvation blockade. We know that we will be slaves if we do not win and we know that the goal of England’s policy of encirclement is to subject Germany to its will [...] The Führer made unprecedented offers for peace and understanding to those who are now fighting against Germany. His attempts were scornfully rejected because they wanted this fight.""* 

Obviously, this is a clear piece of propaganda and has incredible bias throughout, however one can see the very powerful emotions in play. The German mindset, much like with the end of the first World War, was firmly rooted in believing that they were the victims. All they had wanted from the beginning was peace, yet the world rejected it because they feared German power. 1939, according to Germany at the time, was driven by allied *“Envy and Hatred”* towards Germany. It is perhaps this mindset, driven into the German populous for decades during the inter-war period that contributed most to the German rationale during the inter-war period, and not, as you put it, a reluctance to ""bash the fash""

You guys are the same type of media that you fight against, blindly following something that someone else puts out.

&gt;The verses from the Qur'an you mentioned don't prove your point.

Are you saying that the Qur'an doesn't specifically allow a man to fuck his female slaves at will? You and I both know the verses that do so, don't we?

&gt;What do you mean that Muhammad's child died because he was having sex with her?

I worded that improperly, my apologies. The child died that was the result of Muhammad fucking his slave, Mary the Copt.

By the way, I see that you've otherwise completely ignored Mary the Copt and the fact that she is a slave that Muhammad fucked, directly dismissing your claim that Muhammad didn't fuck his slave girls.

&gt;I recommend you actually read up a bit about Muhammad, from non-biased sources

Oh, but everything I know about Muhammad is from Islamic sources. I ignore the Islamic spin, not only because it's plainly obvious but because much of the spin makes absolutely no sense in light of the facts presented, which brings me to your next bit of spin:

&gt;Also, the figure of 900 Banu Qurayza men being executed is the greatest one provided by any historian and is most likely a major exaggeration

It is indeed the highest estimate, but not an estimate made by any ""anti-Islamic"" source. However, just for the sake of your ""argument"", let's make it a ridiculously low estimate - say, 100. 

Of course that number isn't even close to the reality of all of the boys and men of an entire tribe, but for the sake of argument, let's go with that.

I posted this story a long time ago, but here you go.


&gt;When I was about 12 my friend and I found his dad's porn stash. It included 2 videos that set me on the wrong road for sexual expectations. Video 1 was straight vanilla white people having standard vanilla sex. Video 2 was black people all having anal sex. After watching those videos my 12 year old brain told me that **that** must have been the difference. All whites had vaginal sex and all blacks had anal. It wasn't until my first black girlfriend at about 19 that I was told otherwise....I'll let you assume what context this eye opener came from.

And here is the follow-up

&gt;In high school I dated a lot, but never any black girls, they didn't ever seem to respond to my brand of comedy or charm. The year after I graduated I started running around with a guy I worked with that played guitar in a metal band. It was at one of their shows that this black girl finds out that I'm with the band and doesn't want to leave my side. We had a fun night and while the thought of dating some girl I just met at a rock show seemed a bit skeezy she really seemed like a legit nice girl so I figured WTF.

&gt;Fast forward about 2 weeks, we've been dating and it's been good, but I never took it past 2nd base. The thought of sex was there, but I was just enjoying so much of what we already had I didn't think about it too much. Honestly, this being my first relationship out of highschool I might have been a little intimidated. Anyway, we're making out on a couch in the green room before the band goes on one night and things are getting exceptionally hot this time. She's almost ripping both our clothes off not caring that there isn't a lock on the door. She's naked from the waist down with her tits hanging out the top of her shirt and I'm only in my boxers. ""I want to fuck!"" She yells over the loud music from out in the club. I don't remember what I said, but 19 year old me was a real home wrecker so it was probably something like ""OK!"" She bends over and grips the back of the couch, her back to the door and presents me with a glorious view of her bootylicious behind. This is when it hits me. She wants me to stick it in her ass. I don't know why, but I hadn't prepared myself for that mentally. I wanted to say something, but then she said ""Stop thinking about it and fuck me!"" I needed no more encouragement. I dropped my boxers, spit on my hand, slathered it on my dick and just as I was about to slam it in her the music for really loud. Like, way louder than it had been all night. With this girl bent over in front of me though I don't spend more than a second thinking about it. I grab her hips and slam my dick into her full force, exactly as I remember it in the porn from all those years ago. She was bucking and stamping her feet while I rode her hard and she didn't stop the entire time we were going at it. I couldn't hear anything but loud metal so I took it as her being really into it. Eventually she stopped just as I finished and pulled out. I backed up and bent over to grab my boxers and while I was bent over she kicked me in the head. I fell to the ground hard on my ass in a heap. ""What the fuck!"" We both yelled as she cried and got dressed. I stood up, obviously pissed off, but before I could say anything I heard a round of hooting and applause. I turn around completely naked, except for my boxers in my hands that dangled in front of my dick like a cumstained fig leaf, and there are like 15 people including the band I had been there with. Apparently they were coming back to get me to load in, but upon seeing what was going on they gathered as many people as they could in there to cheer me on. It was then that I realized the music had gotten louder because the door to the sound proof green room had been held open. I laughed embarrassed and looked back to my date who was now dressed and leaving via the fire exit. I didn't for the life of me know why she was so upset and chocked it up to her being embarrassed.

&gt;Fast forward to the after party, in other words all of us at a waffle house eating breakfast/dinner at about 4 in the morning. I tell my band mates what happened and they die laughing. They tell me that I need to apologize to her and explain that not all black girls love it up the poop shoot. 

&gt;I tried calling her after that but she wouldn't return my calls. Only time I saw her after that she was at a party I went to. We didn't talk, but I found out after that she let 2 guys there run a train on her. I like to think I contributed to her debauchery in some way"	FALSE

Regarding your roll specifically, I personally am not a huge fan. Braced Frame or Perfect Balance (I prefer the former) are *extremely* handy on higher rate of fire pulse rifles because as you fire more, your weapon will kick more and more, and it only gets worse the higher your rate of fire. While Hidden Hand and Outlaw are excellent options, I still personally prefer Counterbalance for the Clever Dragon as it makes your shooting experience more consistent.

Apparently human bodies are irritatingly efficient and have a bunch of calorie burning processes they can just switch off to save energy, and will do just that for any amount of exercise less than the total daily intake. Let's say 1,500 calories a day are optional and can be shut off- people have to exercise MORE than that to burn past the optional window and start trimming fat. That's like 15 miles of running.

How much did electing its first non-white president really buy the US in real terms? It was a public relations coup worldwide, but what real tangible benefits did it confer on the US to have a diverse, well-spoken president? I am skeptical, but would be genuinely curious about what that would be.

Democracy isn't really democracy. Republics are basically more fluid, semi-competitive oligarchies with a dysfunctional PR machine between it and a very separate mass of people mashing varying degrees of like and dislike buttons in their spare time - and usually the amount of spare time any given individual has is inversely proportional to their effective influence. The idea that gaming this system will always eventually catch up with you is naive. Sometimes it catches up with some of the people gaming it, particularly if they're too blatant. Maybe Trump isn't an insane overgrown child and maybe he's gaming the system in a way that isn't easy to see. And maybe it will catch up with him.

Personally, I feel there's one theory, a not anti-Trump theory, worth seriously considering: by appearing to be such a monster to the rest of the world, he gives other leaders something they want, namely political capital with their own people. Think about, the Mexican President stands tall against the terrible Trump, and earns a lot of political capital from very loudly opposing something that is really quite easy to be against (it really is a no-brainer, with zero risk), and then when he sits down at the negotiating table with Trump (re: NAFTA, which I bet will be rolled into this Mexico paying for the wall thing), he might be willing to give up a bit more, or be a bit more flexible, because he knows he can already go back to his own people with the great political victory of standing up to the POTUS and bringing him to heel.

9100	"One point of clarification--it's not ""feet"" exactly, it's ""legs"".  Hebrew does not have distinct words for ""foot"" and ""leg"", nor between ""hand"" and ""arm"" (there's a word for ""forearm"", so you can make the distinction, but there's nothing wrong with calling your whole arm the same word as ""hand"").  The word רגל *regel* (often in the dual plural רגליים/רגלים *raglayim*.  The standard plural is רגלים *regalim*, but I believe that's only used to mean ""pilgrimages"", and body parts that come in pairs are pretty much always in dual plurals anyway even if the regular plural were an option) in a biblical contexts sometimes means feet, and sometimes is legs, and sometimes is a euphemism for the genitals.  But knowledge that it also means ""legs"" makes the euphemism somewhat more comprehensible.

Even in the Hebrew Bible, there's no need to assume that all or even most uses or this word are euphemisms.  Some of them are, but not all of them are.  Foot washing is a known practice of many societies, and when most transportation on foot is dominant and without modern footwear washing feet makes a lot of sense.

However, there are occasions where ""washing feet"" *could* be a euphemism in the Hebrew bible.  In Kings David tells Uriah to ""go home and wash his feet"" when he is telling him to go home and have sex with his wife (in order to conceal the affair between his wife and David).  But it also could be that ""wash his feet"" is simply a way of telling him to go home and get comfortable, and *that* is the euphemism.  To complicate things more there are later Jewish texts which discuss washing of feet as something wives should do for their husbands, which sounds like it's a euphemism but probably isn't.  That's much later, of course, but still is an interesting way to frame the intersection of this being sexual in nature or not.  But washing of feet is definitely not *always* a euphemism, sometimes it's used when it seems feet are literally being washed.

So ""washing of feet"" can be a euphemism, if context suggests that it is, but it needn't be.  And that's just in the Hebrew bible, which is where the ""feet are a euphemism"" thing comes from.  I can't speak for whether that would make any sense in Greek, but certainly if it were in the Hebrew bible it'd be dubious to suggest it's a euphemism, so all the more so in another language it's not terribly likely."

This is the average sales price, for 3 bedroom houses (only) by PLSS quad, for sales in 2015 and 2016, of houses that sit in Seattle's three Single Family zones (SF5000, SF7200, &amp; SF9600), these zones define the area as Single Family, with a minimum lot size in square feet (many smaller lots are grandfathered in).

The number in each square is the average price (in thousands). The number below, in parenthesis, is the number of sales in that area over the period. I limited this to only 3 bedroom houses, in an effort to keep the scale consistent across neighborhoods (I didn't want any skew if some neighborhoods had more 4 &amp; 5 bedroom houses).

Areas that have no data (and thus have no squares in the image), are areas that don't have any Single Family zoning. For anybody not familiar with Seattle, it sits between two bodies of water. Lake Washington on the east, and Puget Sound on the West. This is one of the reasons that houses on the east and west borders sell for more.

For anybody interested, the PLSS quads are the system used by surveyors to define our lots in much of the US, I felt it was a more logical grouping than trying to do this by neighborhood, since our neighborhood boundaries in Seattle are very fuzzy and aren't official. The PLSS data is part of the lot data provided by the county. The sales data also came from the county.

The sales and PLSS data came from the King County GIS data portal.

The GIS data defining the zoning areas in Seattle, came from the Seattle GIS data portal. Also from the Seattle portal came the streets, and city boundary. "	FALSE

God didn't give us brains to tell Him He's wrong. Sure we are the pinnacle of His creation and our higher brain power compared to other creatures is part of that, but if God says something, who are you to dare to question Him?

There's no sense in comparing what I'm saying about spanking in terms of how the Bible and science diverge to the idea of not having cars. Newsflash: the science behind cars doesn't contradict God's Word. Therefore your argument is stupid.

&gt;Yes, but you never answered my question, *what if you never need to*?

Because God said, ""Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell,"" there is not a possibility of not needing to. We need to because it's a command from God. He says do it, so do it. Even if it wasn't beneficial, it would still be a necessity because God said so. However, God loves us so obeying Him is beneficial. Spanking kids is beneficial to them.

As for the how and when, that's up to parents. If a parent loves their child, I would imagine they'd do it like this: use corporal punishment after the first verbal correction is disregarded, use a rod that is painful but not injurious, be careful not to overdo it, but it is unbiblical to not hit the child hard enough to cry (""Chasten your son while there is hope, and let not your soul spare for his crying.""). I think the punishment should only be just severe enough to cause crying. However, a lot of times children will cry before their punishment happens, and at that point, the Bible clearly says to punish them anyway. I would say do it then until the crying changes from fear crying to pain crying. Any parents here know the difference.

Anyone who pummels their children with punches and breaks bones and causes severe damage is a monster who should be beaten themselves."	FALSE

You could split it up into smaller parts such that some fraction could stay / go, but ...

It's probably going to be more straightforward to have a fixed crew section that stays integral to MCT (though may be used for pressurized cargo as well - using something like airline cargo L-track it's pretty easy to make the interior space quickly modified for different crew counts and amounts of pressurized light cargo (I say light because if the cargo inside crew section must be taken out of the MCT it would be either by hand, or you need an airlock with a crane / lift system, or some kind of elevator airlock, or ... it could be heavy in total, as long as nothing takes more than one or two people to carry each piece).

In either case, there still needs to be some kind of crew access system. I did have some ideas that did indeed involve having an elevator of sorts. I first made the assumption that there would be multiple 'decks' for crew / pressurized cargo/hab space, and that these would then be connected via some sort of central tube running vertically (as oriented when landed). Throw in some dual-use handrails / guide rails and and small overhead 'crane', and you could do a cable operated lift pretty easily for when in gravity wells. However, a cable operated lift doesn't work well with airlocks, so you still need to get from whatever the bottom level is, outside. One way would be to have the bottom level have the actual airlock separately, which then itself could have a crane for use with some kind of basket/whatever ... it beats carrying stuff while going down a ladder, but it's a lot of moving parts (literally) and there's probably a simpler method."

The African portion of the ancestry of black people in America is primarily found in West Africa. So nor are they closely related to Nubians. The Egyptians themselves perceived themselves as distinct from Nubians to the south and did make note of their darker skin color, which in their art is something of a symbol for being Nubian.

The supposed connection between black people in America and the ancient Egyptians is a cultural myth that is the product of the black supremacy movement.

You in real life:

&gt;I condone slavery -- it's moral okay when I benefit.

and:

 I was hoping that someone would bring this up but I'm actually not assuming rational behavior. I know that sometimes people make the wrong choice which means more options could cause them to choose a worse choice. However as long as there is no deception about what the choices are I don't think this counts as  victimization.

If I offer to sell you a penny for $100 and you accept I didn't screw you out of $99.99, you screwed yourself out of $99.99 by being irrational enough to accept

&gt; There is a literature on an effect called ""choice overload."" Some studies suggest that offering more options can create mental distress and make you less happy with your final decision. For example, you're better off at a restaurant with fewer options, because it's easier to choose, and you're less likely to think, ""dang I should have chosen something else.""

So in this case the harm comes because you have to make a choice. I still think that the way many people view these situations ascribes too much victimization to them but that makes sense !delta"	FALSE

If every citizen was to inform himself through the media in order to elect leader and participate in democracy one language had to be spoken by all of France, and since education did not have the means to be what it is today (Nowadays the french education sector is the biggest employer behind the red army), the resources to care for local languages and idiosyncrasies were simply not there.

And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. -- Exodus 21:22-23

The Bible places no value on fetuses or infants less than one month old.

And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. -- Leviticus 27:6

Fetuses and infants less than one month old are not considered persons.

Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD. --Numbers 3:15-16

God sometimes approves of killing fetuses.

And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17 
(Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.)

Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. --Hosea 9:14

Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. --Hosea 9:16

Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- Hosea 13:16

God sometimes kills newborn babies to punish their parents.

Because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. -- 2 Samuel 12:14

God sometimes causes abortions by cursing unfaithful wives.

The priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. ... 
And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. -- Numbers 5:21-21, 27-28

God's law sometimes requires the execution (by burning to death) of pregnant women.

9854	"&gt; My personal perspective is that the discussion of the theory to its actual probability of occurrence is far too high.

Yes, these suggestions *had* been too high.  Now, given the fact that Musk specifically chose to address the topic, it can no longer be so easily dismissed.

&gt; from near-record distances,

Not at all.  There are large number of contractors and employees who could have parked a vehicle within a few hundred meters of the pad.   Even though personal weapons are strictly prohibited on US bases, shootings do happen, and are nearly always perpetrated by those with full authorization to be on the facility grounds.

CCAFS, like most US government facilities, has rather low security.  It would be trivial for an authorized employee or contractor to enter the base with a rifle in their trunk. 

When looking at sabotage, don't consider a guest or infiltrator.  Consider fully authorized individuals.  The precedent shows this has far more typically been the case. 

&gt; without being seen,

Seeing a legitimate employee in a vehicle near the pad wouldn't be a cause for worry.  Firing a rifle from the trunk of a vehicle, as did the [beltway snipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltway_sniper_attacks_) would give every indication of normality.

&gt; without producing any sound that is identifiable as a gunshot,

On a windy day near an industrial site, bangs and noises are common.  Gunshots  are not always clearly recognizable as such. If fired from the ocean side of the pad, may not have even been picked up by the US Launch Report mics.  Suppression is not rocket science, there are simple online instructions for manufacture.

&gt; without any evidence apart from Musk saying it ""hasn't been ruled out"" (which is nearly a null statement)

Of the thousands of tweets Musk received, he selected that one to answer.   In and of itself, this suggests Musk is seriously considering this to be a legitimate avenue of investigation. 

Still, my personal suspicion is that there is currently no evidence of sabotage. If there were, three letter agencies would have enveloped the Cape.  With no reports of Federal law enforcement involvement, it would suggest that Musk has suspicion of subterfuge, but no evidence as yet.

For example, it is possible that in the far future humans will have 6 digits, caused by the upregulation of a protein called Wnt (a type of morphogen). Now we wouldn't say that extra digit has a gene coding for it, but rather the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the Wnt gene was reprogrammed.

Differences in mediums does influence effectiveness. But, this applies both ways. There are generics that absorb faster and more efficiently than their name-brand counterparts.

Generic drugs aren't like knock-off merchandise from China. They aren't produced with cheaper ingredients or cut corners in development. They just don't use the exact same mediums as name-brand, and name brand drugs *do not* always have the best possible composition. They just have the composition they were patented with x years ago.

To say, ""Generics might be good enough for most people, but..."", implies and perpetuates this stigma of Generic vs. Name Brand that is responsible for a lot of shady business practices.

So, yes, average bio-availability and effectiveness are not the same. But, to imply that name-brand is always better is disingenuous and honestly, harmful.

She met extended family and went to live with them. my family was in pieces and my gf left me. we were going to the same school and made sure we were going to be in the same dorm hall. I spent my first weeks of college not eating and calling a suicide hotline multiple times a day. I would stand walk next to busy roads and contemplate  jumping in front of oncoming cars. Eventually my gf started talking to me again. I didn't' let my family know we were back together because I wanted to give them time to try and recover themselves before I even mentioned her around them. The semester was difficult. My gf would spend a lot of days in bed and I would try to just keep her happy. She even had a suicide attempt during the semester. She swallowed pills and i called an ambulance. Since we started dating we had been trying to get her health insurance but none of the social service workers would help us. She needed a therapist and medicine. There were a lot of traumatic events during her childhood that she couldn't cope with along with the abuse and neglect of her mother who I'm sure is a narcissist. she recently got the insurance and anti depressants which have helped a lot. But during the semester i was basically her punching bag. she would tell me she hated me, i was abusive, spineless, pathetic, she would break up with me and not talk to me for days at a time. One time I walked 5 miles to a pharmacy to buy advil because she had a headache. When i got there i realized i didn't have enough money. I texted her apologizing and she wouldn't talk to me for 4 days. All of this was a result of her depression though and now that she has medicine she has been a lot better and she's apologized for it. Bit she still gets very angry and shuts me out. I'm at a point now where my family is slowly healing and my gf has been getting healthier. But she still talks about how she hates my family. and my sister still hates her. Ive been getting more and more depressed over the winter break. I feel extremely alone.

Imo, I'd've supported Leave if Labour were in power at the time, or if it wasn't run by Farage and his cronies.

10077	"To further add to u/XenophonTheAthenian and u/ParallelPain, following the successful occupation of the capital,  the Asakura grew weary of Nobunaga's growth and declared war on the Oda. The Asakura, who had an alliance with the Azai, convinced Nagamasa (head of the Azai and brother-in-law to Nobunaga) to join them. However, in 1570 at Anegawa, an Oda - Tokugawa alliance smashed the Asakura-Azai alliance giving Nobunaga almost unchecked power in central Japan. 

Another major battle that aided Nobunaga's rise and demonstrated his tactical acumen was at Nagashino. Shingen, who had been the leader of the Takeda clan and was considered one of the geniuses of the time, had died in 1573 leaving the clan in the hands of his son Katsuyori. In 1575, Katsuyori led the Takeda and it's famed cavalry to the plains of Shitaragahara in Mikawa and laid siege to Nagashino castle. Tokugawa Ieyasu called on the Oda for help and Nobunaga led his army to meet with the Tokugawa forces. In June of the same year, the two armies met in combat.  The Takeda were renowned for the shock-cavalry tactics perfected under Shingen, and Katsuyori was planning on using this against his enemies; it would be against this cavalry that Nobunaga would demonstrate his brilliant understanding of technology and war. Nobunaga, anticipating the cavalry charge, employed 3,000 arquebusiers in a pattern that allowed for repeated fire (one loads while another shoots). This coupled with Nobunaga's long spear men obliterated the Takeda cavalry and effectively neutered the Takeda army as a whole. 

The final addition I'll add is that Nobunaga was very fortunate when it came to generals in his employ: Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Akechi Mitsuhide (an asset turned liability), Shibata Katsuie, Meada Toshiie, and successful alliance with Tokugawa Ieyasu were major boons to his rise.

10228	"The rule you propose would make it much more difficult for lawmakers to *negotiate* on important issues.  Negotiation is a fundamental tool for any sort of democratic governance.

Let me give you an abstract sort of example.  Imagine that there are three legislators (Alice, Bob, and Carol) and three possible laws that could be passed (A, B, and C) on three very different issues.  Here's what everyone thinks of these three laws:

* **Alice** really wants law A passed, but is mildly against laws B and C.

* **Bob** really wants law B passed, but is mildly against laws A and C.

* **Carol** really wants law C passed, but is mildly against laws A and B.

Individually, any of the three laws A, B, and C has one (emphatic) yes vote and two no votes, so none of the laws can be passed.  However, if we can bundle the three laws together into a single bill, then everyone is in favor of it, because everyone gets what they really want.

The hard part of legislative work is to find such combinations and put them together into single bills that can attract enough votes to pass.  This is a very difficult process of negotiation, and is basically what congress spends most of its time on.  The rule that you propose would make this impossible.

From a very broad perspective, the ""vote on each issue separately"" seems democratic, but in fact does a poor job of representing the will of the voters because it doesn't take into account the *strength* of everyone's preferences.  Negotiation on bundled bills makes it possible for strong preferences to play a role, which in the end benefits everybody."	FALSE

&gt; North Korea said on Sunday a push for further sanctions following its latest nuclear test was &amp;quot;Laughable&amp;quot;, and vowed to continue to strengthen its nuclear power.

&gt; South Korea said on Saturday that the latest test showed North Korea&amp;#039;s nuclear capability was expanding fast and that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was unwilling to alter course.

Bonds keep maturing and new bonds are issued every week or Fortnight. So to reduce the deficit, you skip a week. 
Also people will be very happy to give back the bonds to the Gov if the Gov is willing to pay even a cent above the market price.

As /u/mlp-r34-clopper said, the Gov actually doesn't have to pay the Fed because you know, the Gov owns the Fed. I mean, many Govs across the world use their Fed Reserve to buy the bonds Gov issues if there are no takers (which are usually Banks). And vice-versa. "	FALSE

Obviously, it's not all attributable to Christy Clark, but it is attributable to the approach to governance that BC has taken since 2001, namely diversifying export markets and strengthening FDI, especially in technology and real estate. This is what really distinguishes BC's economy. 

So your theory that as soon as the economy is better, people will look to elect the NDP is clearly flawed as the economy is already doing well. Let's not forget, this is a party that survived the HST debacle as well as the (possible) use of public funds for the ethnic outreach strategy. You can either argue the latest issue is the straw that breaks the camel's back or you can be plainly contradicted by recent history. Both are equally poor arguments in my view. 

My prediction is that the Liberals run with the same themes they used in the by-elections: pump up technology/LNG and never stop talking about the economy, then convincingly defeat the NDP for a fifth consecutive election. The NDP will probably waste all their energy on 'moral' issues that totally fail to address the public's lack of confidence in their ability to be competent governors. Voters will not take a chance on the NDP over some irrelevant 'scandal' when the incumbent party has done a very good job over the last 16 years on the whole."	FALSE

I've said it before, I've never been pro-Hillary and I don't find anything in particular good about her other than the fact that she represents the status quo.  I will probably vote for the libertarian unless polls start to indicate Trump has a chance.  The Republican party doesn't represent me, I mean come on, lately they decided they want to legislate against pornography.  While that's not a huge issue for me, it represents the GOPs desire to legislate my lifestyle in ways that don't affect other people.

Trump himself is a whole other ball game.  In my opinion, he is a loud-mouth asshole who will shoot off his mouth with the slightest provocation.  I wouldn't want him in control of our military and especially the nuclear codes.  He is obviously pandering to people who are racist even though I admit Muslim terrorism is a major growing problem.  His isolationist policies are unrealistic and are likely to cripple the economy.  Going back to my original point though, he is a man of disgusting character and I would be embarrassed to have him represent us to the world.  Those are just a few things that come to mind.

Seriously, how could you have respect for a candidate who will openly say that he can go out and shoot his supporters and his favoraibility  rating wouldn't' be affected.  I have more self-respect than to support somebody who is obviously an aspiring dictator (based off of his words).  That also raises another point, that it seems likely that Trump will be overcome with admiration from Putin that he would look the other way as Putin continues to be the aggressor in Eastern Europe which will further weaken NATO.  To put it simply, Trumps infatuation with Putin and strong men in general will weaken the US geopolitically.

&gt; Of the players featured on the special-edition Kinder chocolates, at least two - G&amp;uuml;ndogan and Leverkusen midfielder Christoph Kramer - will miss out on this year&amp;#039;s tournament due to injury or non-selection.

I think the main thing about this solution that would trip people up is not understanding how number systems work (i.e. the idea that in base ten, ""142"" means ""1×10^2 + 4×10^1 + 2×10^0"" which means ""1x100 + 4x10 + 2x1."") 

Or in other words: From left to right, the digits are multiplied by descending powers of ten (base ten!)

For me, that was kind of a revelation. Until I encountered binary (base two) it didn't occur to me that in my normal base ten life I was even using a system, and that numbers could be represented equally sensibly in other ways.

EDIT: Fixed some numbers and rephrased for clarity (hopefully.)

I believe the article I already linked is his most explicit post about it. Adding his speech about BLM not caring about black lives where he claimed that black people are more violent than white people, and you have a pretty compelling case. His original justification for those comments was that he was talking about culture, not race. Now he's saying that same culture is created by race.

Would it be unusual for a Nazi who believes that the Aryan race is scientifically superior to not support racial purity as a government policy? Openly, yes. Hitler was such a strong advocate of it that it would be dangerous politically to be openly anti-eugenics. Generally? No, as we've seen, prominent members took moderate positions on the issue and fought to temper the extent of those laws, and admitted later to not particularly supporting them at all. Would milo be willing to stand up in the Reichstag and directly oppose Hitler at his peak of power over one of the fuhrer's most core beliefs? No, he's a smart man and he knows to pick his battles. He'd stand on the side of the argument to moderate the implementation.

Milo's views would make a fairly moderate Nazi, but they would fit right in. Racial superiority, by genetics and by culture, a need to preserve what is good about white culture. He's not a perfect example, but you can't expect everyone in a political group of any sort to have exactly the same views. Is it inaccurate to call him one? I don't believe so. "	FALSE

Having a continent following a single religion allowed religious ruling mandates to cross state borders meaning conquests weren't exterminations or complete subjugation (slavery) thanks to Christianity. Slavery of foreign peoples by Europeans was only flimsily justified by claiming other races were inferior and slavery of conquered populations within Europe was relatively rare. Considering the destabilising nature of slavery and how it promotes state fragmentation this is certainly an important part in the rise of Europe which Jared completely ignores.

In short yes Jared's analysis of technological progress is flawed but his analysis of food production as a means for early establishment of states isn't.

We could easily criticize the methodology of their studies or whatever but if we take it at face value the main argument is that women tend to not have a *necessity* to mature emotionally after a certain point. They have formulated thoughts and opinions and ideologies well before men have even begun to be able to formulate such conventions to such a level. Moreover looking at the average trajectory of women at this time they relied on their parents, some would get an education, and then get married essentially for a majority of their lives women were in an environment where they were allowed to develop freely and more thoroughly than men. Then at whatever age in their 20s they would settle down.

 By this time however the women already have their opinions and ideas solidified and they also have the support of their friends and naturally are able to out-maneuver most men in such complexities. As such there is no challenging or progression. I would argue that its not that women CAN'T emotionally mature past a certain point but rather DON'T HAVE TO because they have found what works for them.

I'm willing to consider an addendum that may extend an olive branch to those frustrated by this reasoning. In today's world perhaps that development/maturity goes further into or including their early 20s (formative college years) especially those in a more challenging curriculum (think engineering as opposed to gender studies.) These women in professional environments undoubtedly still mature and face challenges and ultimately grow.

 Both women's and men's brains continue to develop and aren't even fully formed until the 20s however emotional maturity is more complex than just the formation of the brain; a huge part of it is the environment in which you grow up. As another poster mentioned women sexually mature faster and are thrust into a whole other reality about themselves and society that men don't even realize till much later and as such are force to ""mature."" But at the same time because they have found out what works and they have this so-called advantage they are less likely to be challenged emotionally in the social spectrum until men catch up at around 28 by that time you're essentially asking someone to forgo a decades worth of social conditioning and experiences.

10494	"Is it safe to assume that an evil god giving free will has the same motivations, or even has only inverse motivations for the same actions that a good god has? Why would a good god give free will for the inversely same reasons that an evil god would? He's trying to mirror the argument in order to refute it, but doesn't this narrow down morality too much?

And there are plenty of ""evil"" gods by modern western Christian standards. Kali, hades, shiva, virtually any God that is traditionally considered pagan is often amoral or down right evil to non worshippers. Even older Jewish beliefs sometimes portray their god as being somehow above our understanding of morality. 

Did god create choice and free will? Did he do it for the reasons stated above? Wouldn't this mean that god could've also not given free will? If god giving free will was an act of goodness, and if it was the only option of a good god as is the required judgement for this refutation to work, then is it not more plausible that the evil god would refuse to create free will, which is itself considered a good act? 

An evil god is just as likely to take away free will as he is to give it, but a good god could never be good without free will. They cannot mirror each each other. This video is a very narrow refutation of a very specific set of explanations, any one of which can be tweaked to nullify the refutation. I don't think what he's trying to refute is a very strong argument for god to begin with, so maybe that's why I find his mirrored argument so problematic.

If I understand correctly, you are describing a vaginal orgasm. Try to ask him to finger you and stimulate the G-Spot.

Shortly - he need to use his fingers in a 'come here' motion until he feel on the top of your vagina a walnut growing bigger ( about two knuckles in, two fingers is more than enough ).

&amp;nbsp;


That's right. But they don't have to cancel all the kinetic energy from launch. You miss 2nd stage, the payload mass and a bunch of fuel. Musk once said 30% of total fuel is needed for the first stage to return back to the barge. That said, the velocities and trajectories differ between missions and after thinking about it, they might locate the barge closer to KSC if they have some room to spare in fuel quantity. You could be right on always full quantity fuel.

&gt; low volume kerosene spray

&amp;nbsp;


RP-1 has a flashpoint of 43.33^^o C. It's hard to ignite in atmospheric circumstances and certainly when it is chilled to -7^^o. To me it seems impossible; LEL will never be reached. A spray will only increase the amount of potential ignitable vapour, not lower the flashpoint AFAIK, however it (the fuel) will reach higher temperatures way faster. This fuel is stable at room temperature and there is no need to have pressure on the line or tank (from the fuel perspective). Yes it will increase in volume due to warming, but that effect will negligible because of large volume. One degree C maybe and a couple of centimetres in sounding. Besides they probably stopped loading at that time, so pump off, no pressure in lines, tower fuel line content will flow down due to gravity. No, quite sure this theory is false.

&amp;nbsp;

 
The characteristics of LOX I'm less familiar with. It isn't flammable in itself but I have no knowledge of possible chemical reactions / circumstances where it might combust apart from being a mixture with RP-1 in the engine. There is a higher risk of over pressure since the fluid can expand from volume at -207 degrees to a larger volume at -183 at which point it will simply boil off and remain constant in temperature. If they don't leave room for this expansion and for some reason this happens (don't see how yet, increase should be quite slow) it would mean trouble.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Also, the edge of the plume of the initial explosion was already showing signs of black soot

To me it seems as if the LOX vapour escapes from the ruptured tank and it's white behind the flash which due to overexposure looks darker.

1. I did not do anything endgame. Ill have to take your word for it. But after 30 hours of doing exactly that, I did not want to do anymore. My point is exaggerated, yes, but I am trying to convey the reasoning to another player as to why I did not like this game. Yeah I constantly held square and then pressed ""regroup"" to regen hp, but that was about it. I never used a different technique.

2. Mega phoenixes also came with the point of it consumed a characters turn. It was a tactical choice. Also, mega phoenixes were usually very difficult to find or endgame. Regular phoenix downs are available at the start of XV and have no drawback to using them.

3. I think you're being a little nitpicky about what controlling your companions means. The techniques are a joke in comparison to fleshing out the party in previous games. In FFVII-VIII you can get yourself killed and stuck in a portion of the game just because you have a shitty makeup and left your materia on different characters. Big difference here from XV.

4. Quadcast casts the same spells I listed 4 times. Okay there are limit break magics I missed. I still don't want to spend 30 hours of gaming before I get another spell. In the original first Final Fantasy you would cast berserk on a dual wielding ally that could then 8x attack on the enemy boss. There were over 50 spells in the first game of this series. That does not happen in XV. 

5. I didn't say you couldn't fast travel. Besides, fast travel activates after you've visited a place for the first time. There are portions of the game where you know you did the same thing.

I think also the role of a college professor is more attractive to those with liberal temperaments. I'm painting with a broad brush, but those who identify as liberals tend to prioritize compassion/caring, are more people-oriented more so than conservatives who are more conscientious, individualistic, and prioritize justice/responsibility.

I believe in you, really, I know we all here are random strangers, but just to read and feel how much you love them warms my heart, because love is the most powerfull feeling that exists and with love you will have hope and with hope you will have the push-up that you need to keep going on and accomplish all those hopes.

If you're being an actual dick or toxic or offensive in any way then yeah, stop it, but teabagging is different. It's kind of like how in soccer a lot of people get annoyed if you try some flashy tricks - or try to beat a defender with a nutmeg or stepovers or something. They think it's pointless showing off or bravado with the sole intent of just humiliation. But I see it as fun - and if you can pull it off then pull it off  - and yeah there is an aspect of machismo to it, but not in any way that is truly hurtful or malevolent. There are players who get kicked the shit out off by defenders because they try so many tricks, and they're seen as some sort of dumb punks. That is the kind of thing i disagree with. They're not being abusive or breaking any rules. Maybe it is a generational thing, but I think it's more of a mindset thing. I doubt there will ever be a time I get annoyed at someone for teabagging me. All it does is make me more motivated to one up them - it lights a spark of competitive spirit and I enjoy that. 	FALSE

No, there were no changes to the alphabet in English relating to A at Chaucer's time.

The English had originally adapted the Latin alphabet with two addition characters, the thorn and the edh. The alphabetical order we have comes from late Roman antiquity, but even before the Roman state was founded, the Italic languages started with some sort of A-shaped letter, having adopted the Cumaean version of the Greek alphabet, which already had the A letter and sound value. The Greeks adapted their letters from the Phoenicians, where the analogous letter, aleph, had a similar-ish shape but a different consonantal sound value which was meaningless in the Greek language and replaced.

10674	"If you read the full article,  you'll see that this strike was a result of the new liberties being given to political parties  and unions in the aftermath of the referendum result. 

*In a shock to the regime, 57,2% of voters voted against the proposal. The vote marked the start of negotiated return to democracy. The military's belief that it needed to legitimize their proposed constitution by holding an actual referendum but lost, as opposed to simply falsifying the voting results, was itself an indication that democracy was not quite dead yet in Uruguay.*

*On September 1, 1981, General Gregorio Conrado Álvarez, who was secretary of the National Security Council since 1973 and Commander-in-Chief of Uruguayan Armed forces from 1978 to 1979, assumed the presidency. He began negotiations with civilian politicians about returning power to elected officials. On June 7, 1982, a law allowed the traditional political parties (Blancos, Colorados, and Civic Union Party) to resume their activities, but leftist parties remained banned. On November 28, elections were held to elect representatives to political party conventions, which then were expected to select new leaders, who then would be allowed to participate in the presidential elections of 1984.[10]*

So,  already in 1982 the military junta had thrown in the towel and accepted elections in 1984, and a full return to democracy in 1985. The 1984 strike was more of a show of force of unions than anything else,  the transition having been decided two years before. 

Also,  the general strike of 1973 was in response to the military coup d' etat. It was very much longer,  two weeks,  than the one in 1984, and was ruthlessly repressed. The junta did not care too much for the economic consequences.

I would honestly say Paul Ryan is the poster boy if anything. Honestly I don't think Sanders did very good in the debate. He didn't look good against the younger Cruz.

&gt;it'd be interesting to see if it works as planned but with how things are going lately I don't see it getting much support from the left. 

Yeah well *I* hope that Republicans don't treat the Dems like the Dems treated Republicans during the ACA. I hope we can get a functional system in place.

&gt;Not sure if they'd need it but dems could surely make things difficult if they wanted to. And it looks like they want to since the trump administration seems a bit off the rails. 

Republicans can remove the 60 vote cloture rule and go back to simple majority and pass whatever they want. *I* think they will threaten that until Democrats play ball.

&gt;I assume you're Republican since you said ""we,"" can I ask how you feel about how things are going since he inauguration? 

Honestly I didn't vote for Trump because IMO he isn't a Republican he is a liberal who won on populism and the working white vote.

That being sad I don't feel Trump's administration is really off the rails. He hasn't doing anything that is grossly irresponsible yet.

&gt; * LUCKNOW: Favourites India came from a goal down to pip Australia 4-2 via shootout in a thrilling contest and enter the final of the men's Junior Hockey World Cup after a hiatus of 15 years in front of a packed Major Dhyan Chand Astroturf Stadium here today.India, who last won the Junior World Cup way back in 2001 in Hobart, are on a mission to reclaim the title and will face Belgium in the summit clash on Sunday.The hosts scored two skilful field goals in the second half through Gurjant Singh (42nd minute) and Mandeep Singh (48th) after Australia took the lead through Tom Craig (14th).But just when it was time to close out the game, the Indian defence conceded a soft goal and Lachlan Sharp (57th) drew level for Australia to take the match into shoot-out after both the teams were locked at 2-2 at the end of regulation time.In the shoot-out, goalkeeper Vikas Dahiya rose to the occasion and made two fantastic saves to deny Australia's Matthew Bird and Sharp.The Indians, on the other hand, were clinical in the shoot-out with skipper Harjeet Singh, Harmanpreet Singh, Sumit and Manpreet (Jr) finding the back of the net past the Australian custodian.Earlier today, India's final opponents Belgium stunned six-time champions and title holders Germany 4-3 in the shootout in the first semi-final to enter the tournament final for the first time.Belgium rode on their goalkeeper Loic van Doren's superb display in the shoot-out to register the upset win after the two teams failed to break the deadlock in regulation 70 minutes.Van Doren made two brilliant saves in the shoot-out to deny Germany's Philip Schimid and Tim Herzbruch.In the second semi-final, India had the better share of possession in the opening half but it was Australia who utilised their chances.It seemed Australia took a cue from the Spaniards as they hardly gave any space to the Indians, relying mainly on man to man marking.Australia utilised the first chance they got in the match.

&gt; * The Burras earned their opening penalty corner in the 13th minute and Tom Craig scored from the third attempt with a reverse shot from close range after the initial flick and rebound were saved by the Indian defence.Australia preferred to sit back and rely mainly on counters to surprise the Indians.Australia secured two consecutive penalty corners in the 22nd minute but this time India goalkeeper Dahiya came to his side's rescue to deny Blake Govers from the second attempt.India pressed hard and minutes later earned two back to back penalty corners but Harmanpreet Singh failed to find the back of the net on both occasions.In the 32nd minute, Varun Kumar found Vikramjit Singh inside the circle but the latter's shot went straight to Australian goalkeeper Ashleigh Thomas' pads.The hosts had their best opportunity of the opening half in the next minute when Varun's long scoop from deep found Simranjeet Singh unmarked inside the circle after an Australian defender fumbled, but the striker pushed wide with only the rival custodian to beat.

&gt; I can't disagree with anything you said, but you seem to be implying that communism or socialism is the solution.

10791	"I think the most likely interpretation of the phrase is that when a situation ""has come to the triarii,"" it has become dire.  The situation has breached two safety nets and is now hangs upon the last ""line of defense.""  The *hastati* and then the *principes* have both failed to do their jobs, and we get the impression that only rarely did the *triarii* have to get involved and set matters straight.  Livy (8.8) tells us that the *hastati* were the young-uns of the army, followed in the second rank by the *principes* (and these names make no sense in this arrangement, I know).  The *triarii* were the old-timers, the most experienced, and typically rested on one knee during the battle (also 8.8).  Actually, now that I look at it, 8.8 is the source of the phrase as well!

There is a reference in the comic poet Plautus to the *triarii* which suggests they were well-known for hardly ever exerting effort:

&gt; Agite nunc, subsidite omnes quasi solent triarii! (""Come now, everybody sit down just like the *triarii* are always doing!"")(Varro L.L. 5.89)

As for examples of battles involving the *triarii,* Livy conveniently provides an example of the *triarii* turning the tide of battle just a little bit below the source of the phrase itself, during a description of a fight between the Romans and the Latins (Book 8 deals with the First Samnite War and the Settlement of Latium, 341-321 BCE):

&gt;When Manlius heard the fate of his colleague, he honoured his glorious death with tears no less than with the due meed of praise. Meantime the battle proceeded, and in some quarters the weight of numbers was giving the advantage to the Latins. For some time Manlius was in doubt whether the moment had not come for calling up the triarii, but judging it better for them to be kept fresh till the final crisis of the battle, he gave orders for the accensi at the extreme rear to advance to the front. When they came up, the Latins, taking them for the opposing triarii, instantly called up their own. In the desperate struggle they had tired themselves out and broken or blunted their spears, but as they were still driving the enemy back by main force, they imagined that the battle was decided and that they had reached their last line. Then it was that the consul said to his triarii: ""Rise up now, fresh and vigorous against a wearied foe; think of your country and your parents and wives and children; think of your consul lying there dead that ye might win the victory!"" They rose up fresh and resplendent in their armour, as though a new army had suddenly sprung up, and after letting the antepilani retire through them they raised their battle-shout. The front ranks of the Latins were thrown into disorder, the Romans thrust their spears into their faces, and in this way killed the main support of their army. They went on without being touched through the remaining companies as though through a crowd of unarmed men, and they marked their advance with such a slaughter that they left hardly a fourth part of the enemy. The Samnites, too, who were drawn up close to the lowest spurs of the mountain, were threatening the Latins on their flank, and so adding to their demoralisation. . .

&gt; [but the Latin leaders said that] the Romans enjoyed no more than the name of victory, in every other respect they were as good as defeated. The headquarters of both consuls were polluted with blood; the one had murdered his son, the other had devoted himself to death; their whole army was massacred, their hastati and principes killed; the companies both in front of and behind the standards had suffered enormous losses; the triarii in the end saved the situation. The Latin troops, it was true, were equally cut up, but Latium and the Volsci could supply reinforcements more quickly than Rome. . . [Livy 8.10-11"	FALSE

it's pretty tough; i remember reading that it had to be polished with diamonds, because it was such a hard metal. 

i probably worry too much, but it seems worth saying... silicone rings might also be good for when he's at work if he regularly drives a truck with racks or other things like that on it, or works with machinery; it's probably not a super common occurrence (i hope), but my husband and i actually had those initially because one of our friends lost a finger getting his ring stuck on part of his truck :( . 

&gt; The pinkie tattoos+real rings is such a good idea! Do your tattoos match or are they different? My friends who got ring tattoos both got their favorite animals (hers is a snail, his is...I think an elephant? I forget) where the stone would be, and then a ring going all the way around. They were by the same artist, so they're similar stylistically but still individual to each person. They're really cool.

those rings sound so cute! i love seeing people get creative with rings and ring tattoos like that. our ring tattoos do match :) i had loved the story of it for a long time, so we both got [red string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_string_of_fate) ""tied"" around our pinkies.

All public universities cost more or less the same and are cheaper and more respected than the private universities. But for some schools and courses like medicine the competition is really hard and you need very high percentile grades.

Thie film ends with *him* being rescued, not him rescuing anybody else. 

He doesn't save the day in Return of the Jedi either, at least at the end. He does rescue them from Jabba's barge in the beginning, but in the final battle he doesn't do shit. He shows up on the death star, refuses a fight, and then gets tortured a bit. VADER saves the day by killing the Emperor while Luke lies helpless on the ground.

Even as a Catholic myself, giving everyone the option to send their kid to a school of their choice with no tax penalty sounds good to me.

The only argument against it is an argument against religion itself.  Which I know will be popular on reddit, but not in the real world where the majority of the population is still religious.

Anyone telling you it was natural evolution is wrong, humans took wolves and purposefully selected for behavioural traits. One study showed that the 11 fixed gene changes between wolves today and dogs affect things like adrenaline and noradrenaline, as well as dopamine etc, stuff that controls aggression and the fight or flight response. Dogs get fearful much less often than wild animals being the main thrust.

Same way we made the modern cow, sheep, pig. 

It sounds kind of harsh, but dogs were the first species human domesticated, the oldest remains of a dog buried beside a human are 14,700 years old meaning humans did not yet have written language, the wheel, numbers and counting, etc, etc. No one knows exactly where or how, but the genetic evidence is pretty good.

And Milo always went further than just allowing people with extreme views to speak their minds (so long as they weren't Muslim). His primary argument was that people with extreme views were entitled to venues, and that it was beyond the pale to call someone spouting white nationalist rhetoric a Nazi. Nobody ever said he couldn't speak, just that he's not entitled to speak in certain places or not face a backlash for his own speech. That people saying offensive things shouldn't be fired or lose contracts, the ability of that person to continue working with the people they insulted be dammed.

10916	"&gt;Contrast this with truly feminized societies like Sweden. Sweden constantly takes on an endless flow of immigrants, who in many cases rape and harass women in Sweden. But Swedish men are too weak to stop it. They cannot fight.

In 2014 the incidence of Rape in Sweden was [69 per 100,000 persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden), while in 2013 the incidence of rape in the United States was [240 per 100,000 persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_United_States). The incidence of rape in the US is more than three times the incidence in Sweden. It seems pretty clear that no matter how weak Swedish men might be, they're pretty good at preventing rapes. 

I'm still interested in hearing your response to this point from my last response.

&gt;I see two problems with this argument and example. First of all, the lack of traditional family units among African Americans predates feminism by a large margin. When slavery was practiced in the United States family units didn't have to be sold together. Husbands, wives, and children were frequently separated from each other. Coping with this separation meant putting less importance on traditional family structures. Even after the institution of slavery ended the cultural impact remained.

10923	"&gt; But I don't think anyone expects the Turing Test to be the first, last and only test we use for consciousness. In 1,000 years, after (I assume) we've discovered the physical/neurological basis for consciousness we won't need the Turing Test anymore, we'll just have a scanner that checks for consciousness. 

I contend that such a scanner is logically an impossibility.

In order to create a reliable test for something, you need to have known quantities of said thing first. For example, if I had a device that I claim was 100% accurate at detecting gold, you would use it on known samples of gold and known samples of not-gold to verify its usefulness.

So if you came to me with a device that said Tom Cruise has consciousness and a rock does not, how do I know Tom Cruise is not a p-zombie and how do I know the rock doesn't have some type of consciousness we humans just haven't imagined yet? You haven't demonstrated a truly accurate device, you have merely demonstrated a device that reaffirms preexisting assumptions.

The hard problem of consciousness, the subjectivity, whatever you want to call it...that thing is 100% immune to scientific inquiry, because it is 100% internal. It is non-observable by an outside observer. It's outside of science.

I am sympathetic to those who believe p-zombies are very unlikely, but strongly opposed to statements that call them impossible. How can we possibly conclude that all humans have an observable quality about them? We cannot. To claim with certainty that any person or thing has an observable quality is to cast science and reason aside and operate purely from wishful thinking."	FALSE
10924	"No worries.

It is very telling that the ultimate sin, according to the Abrahamic death cults, is the sin of knowledge, the sin of not placidly obeying authority, the sin of curiosity, and the sin of being what we are told is the creation of a perfect being in His ""own image"".

And in the renovation of the horrible, jealous, sadistic and dishonest God of the Old Testament, this nightmarte deity *still* requires that a being He supposedly caused to live be tortured horribly and left to die miserably in order for Him to forgive mankind for being exactly as He claims we were made.

Would a ""perfect"" omnibenevolent and ""loving"" all-powerful entity not be able to simply forgive out of the resources of His own character and limitless love? Why would He demand a human sacrifice?

And if the unfortunate proto-hippy, Joshua ben Joseph, known to his friends as Jesus, *did* ""die for our sins"", then why are we threatened endlessly with being sent to eternal punishment for those very sins? 

And how is it ethically possible for someone else to take on a punishment for the sins of another? 

How is it ethical to impose eternal punishment for finite skin? 

And assuming the omnipotence and omnisciece of God, one must assume He knows what the future holds, and knowing this, He must have known that man would succumb to his nature and seek knowledge via the rather silly fruit delivery system, and He must have known he would end up murdering every person on earth minus one family and their cargo of seasick livestock, and He must have known about all the wars and torture and slavery and genocide and exploitation and rape and murder and violence and hunger and depression and misery His creation would experience, and how it would repeatedly fail to live up to His impossible standards. 

So why, knowing all this, would He do any of it at all? 

He would have to be a sadist with a sick voyeuristic and sociopathic desire to witness failure and suffering.

If God is infinitely powerful, the why does He permit evil to exist at all?

I have heard all kinds of excuses and justifications and rationalizations about free will and the choices we make, but if God knows the future, then there is only one future, and that means there is no free will, only the illusion of it.

11060	"I figured that since I am not a Warcraft fan, I can give my point of view of the movie from someone who is more neutral. I went to the cinema expecting nothing and was pleasantly surprised.

Of course the beginning of the movie was confusing as hell for me and not only too many characters were introduced all at once but too many locations too. Head was spinning a little and I saw the kids in front of me losing interest already despite all the eye candy.

Then, the first fight between the humans and the Orcs started and I was finally taken in. So were the kids. The action sequences were amazing for a movie filled with CG and I could feel the excitement and the fear. Simply superb special effects considering that I felt that even X-Men Apocalypse had too many unrealistic CG sequences.

When the movie introduced Garona, I was totally hooked. Finally, some actual character development for a character that wasn't already having so much untold background story - hers was simple enough that I can relate to. She was sort of an outcast and had to build up her identity in Azeroth. Being new to the world myself, I saw it through her eyes. Fantastic! I was finally hooked to the story and it wasn't halfway through the movie yet.

I don't want to reveal spoilers so I guess I will have to end here but hopefully I have helped to show you how a person who never played WoW was impressed by the movie and could actually follow what was going on after the introduction of Garona. The twist at the end was unexpected for me too so that was excellent!

Great movie overall! Just that the beginning could have been so much better if the directors just showed the world from Garona's perspective."	FALSE

The reason why the RNC was so against Trump during the primary season was because they were afraid that he would not only lose, but lose so badly that the coattail effect would mean a Democratic senate and maybe even a Democratic house. Well, Trump just didn't win. He won by doing what Republicans have *dreamed* of doing since 2000: winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

The RNC isn't going to put up an ""establishment"" candidate because Trump *is* the Republican establishment at this moment. And since he's the leader of the party, don't hold your breath for any sort of coup. Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line. The only time in modern history when a Republican mounted a serious campaign to primary an incumbent president was Reagan in 1976 – and those were unique circumstances because Ford wasn't nominated by the Republican electorate or elected by the general one."

My understanding is that voter turnout was quite low among eligible voters during the first decades of the United States's existence. It rose dramatically around mid-century after the extension of universal male suffrage and the rise of mass political parties. US elections of the late 1800s were notorious for having extremely high (white male) voter turnout, generally over 70%, because of influential social and political institutions that we would probably describe as corrupt. To simplify matters, your local party organization would sign you up if necessary and get you to the polls, perhaps more than once, maybe ply you with liquor, threaten you if you didn't vote their way, or offer you a job if you did. Exactly how these political machines worked differed from place to place, but it was generally not something we would recognize as standard election day practice. The reforms of the Progressive Era -- the secret ballot, instatement of voter registration requirements, and so forth -- drove down voter turnout around the turn of the 20th century, as did discriminatory laws aimed at African-Americans and poor citizens."

11180	"I always felt one of the defining facets of Stannis' storyline was him not getting what he ""deserved"". From Proudwing to Storm's End to the Kingship, he never gets what he deserves but he presses on anyways. It's admirable. It's also why I feel he shouldn't end up with a ""grander"" death. It's in keeping with that little tragedy of his character. Though in a way, the wall is very inglorious, so that's why I like him ending up there :)

And that is a great analysis! Though it's funny, I agree so much on the foreshadowing and build up to why it has to be Stannis burning Shireen - and it is so nice to see people noticing how much his story has been culminating in that for a change, instead of using it to bash the show - but I disagree completely with much of the show criticism. For example, Stannis winning at the wall then losing to the Boltons completely keeps with GRRM's theme of ""undercutting victories"". 

What's more, I feel if Stannis only has to burn Shireen when he's literally faced with the Others bearing down on him, the difficulty of the sacrifice is lessened and the sacrifice lost a bit. I think most people literally faced with the literal apocalypse could understand the sacrifice Stannis made far more easily, and would probably do the same. But Stannis is trying to plan ahead. He needs to take Winterfell to fight the Walkers; he needs to unite his kingdom to save it. As much as his character has atheistic tendencies, a lot of his arc relies on faith - his faith in Melisandre and the AA prophecy in particular. By keeping Shireen's sacrifice more an act of faith, there's a lot more thematic resonance and tragic nuance to it. Stannis knows the Others are coming; why is it okay to sacrifice her if he's faced with them but not when he still has time to prepare? It's a nice way to parallel the atrocities committed in the name of Faith over the years - are they wrong because they're based only in Faith? Would they be more morally acceptable if they were based in more fact? If we know magic is real (all readers do) and Mel's magic is real (most readers believe so) and believe her Red God to be real (many readers do), then is it okay to sacrifice a child? To save thousands of soldiers? To save the world? Is that not the just thing to do?

But my therapist has asked me to at least think through possible answers to the same question at times, in the hope that it might yield some self-discovery, and sometimes, it has. (Other times, I'll admit, it feels like a horseshit question to even be asking.)   
  
Depends on the person's motivations for asking whether they meant it cluelessly, insultingly or perhaps perceptively. For the latter, like, I don't want to *feel* like this at all — but while I do, especially at its worst, it's a much better excuse for what I know is already my natural inertia. It's more obvious when I'm a ""body at rest"" rather than a ""body in motion,"" but inertia either way is way too easy for me, even when my depression's being treated.  
  
You don't owe anyone else any answers, but I can help in my own treatment when I'm at least honest with myself of any upsides to my depression, small though they might *feel* ... if only so I identify them and don't let myself get too attached to them, which would only make it easier to make ""being depressed"" my new normal.  
  
A lot of days, though, separating my medical condition of depression from my emotional feelings of depression from my natural state of inertia is a tough set of plates to spin.

Is Mavic meant to be filling an extreme sports coverage niche, and the future of the product line and its features are headed towards compactness and nimbleness alone; while the Phantom focuses on slow precise and stable for indie narrative and documentary films...? 

The future of these product families is important to anyone looking to invest in one of these systems. It's going to affect the development and availability after-market accessories, the kinds of accessories, and likely the kinds of firmware updates you'll see and changes to the specific software.

The test could be mandatory but the results do not have to be published and the putative father is not forced to even look at the results if they don't want to.

11315	"I started doing a technique that changed my life. Every time I go to sleep now I can't be happier. I read about it somewhere. I forget where exactly. 

The technique is simple:

1) Get an empty jar.

2) At the end of the day, write down the things you achieve in a small piece of paper. 

The paper should only have one thing. They don't have to be just about your work. It could be about your personal life. For  example, you invited a friend for a coffee. You did the laundry that day, ... etc. They also don't have to be about the completed tasks. You should write down anything you did. The jar should be placed in a visible spot in the living room where you can always see it. 

The benefits of this technique are:

* You will realize how much you actually do every day. 

* It trains your brain on focusing on the positive side of your daily life. 

* It improves your self-esteem. If you follow that for a few days, I think you would have a much better positive attitude on yourself and less guilty nights.   

**Edit:** I honestly didn't expect people to like this technique. I reformatted my post to be more readable. Here is a picture of my jar after a few months: http://imgur.com/ebciEca

Now I think I need a bigger jar. :)

11341	"I'm not going to get sucked into the trap of prescribing what I do, to you.

But some pointers;

- Unless you're racing, or running for a specific goal, specific to that one run, don't run past a pace that you can still talk.
- Just breathe in until your lungs feel full, then exhale until they feel empty. 

Let your bodies need for oxygen determine how often you're breathing in and out.

At my own cruising pace, there is no way I could fill or empty my lungs in 2/3 strides. But that's just me. Some shockingly generalised math would guess that I empty and refill my lungs on a 7 or 8 second cycle. When I run up hill, it changes. When I race, it changes.

Just look at things the right way round. Don't count anything. Just breathe easy. If you can't get enough oxygen in, slow down. The problem will not be in your breathing, it'll be your pace.

If you really can't get out of your own head enough, try reciting something aloud. (Don't pick a nursery rhyme or song, as they'll follow a cadence). Reel off your families names from oldest to youngest. Or think about and say aloud (not too loud) all the words you can think about beginning with a certain letter.

Prior to that, it was not clear if the federal government's interstate commerce power extended to commerce within a single state that incidentally affected the overall market in other states. Without a constitutional amendment, the most the federal government could have done following its contemporary dogma would have been to ban the importation or interstate transportation of alcohol. Banning the production or sale of alcohol within a single state was thought to be beyond the power of the federal government at the time. For similar reasons, even as late as 1934 the federal government relied on its taxation power instead of interstate commerce in order to regulate the possession of machine-guns under the National Firearms Act. If the Volstead Act [the law that implemented prohibition] had only banned importation and interstate trade of alcohol, some states likely would have refused to pass state laws banning alcohol in their state (as two of the then 48 states refused to ratify the 18th amendment).

I'd like to see the data supporting this. I'm not saying that you're wrong, but I haven't seen the data.

&gt;even if one victim decides not to bring charges (this could be for a variety of reasons- maybe he/she couldn't identify their rapist, maybe they've had bad experiences with the police, maybe they're afraid of their rapist, etc) for valid reasons, not running the kit anyway completely eliminates the possibility of detecting a serial rapist and prosecuting them fully when multiple documented cases incriminate them.

You do realize that the ""stranger lurking in the bushes"" is the vast minority of rape cases, right? If there is an identifiable suspect who disputes the sex, the rape kits are processed. That's standard practice. 

&gt;you're only speaking to a minority of rape cases- the vast majority never make it to court, let alone follow that specific scenario you described.

Yet you think ""stranger rape"" where the victim actually gets the kit done is more common that what I've suggested? I spent two years in the prosecutor's office. Multiple other people with actual work experience in the field are confirming what I'm saying in this thread.

I get that you're a victim advocate, but it's a good idea to actually get familiar with the facts involved instead of running off of pure emotion.

11451	"Between at least the 18th into the 19th century, anatomical specimens (cadavers, skeletons, bones, organs, etc.) were regularly produced by grave robbing or outright murder (see Rosner's book on the[ Burke and Hare case](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14677.html).) Though this practice began to subside with ""anatomy acts"" legislated in the 19th century in the UK and USA, which attempted to curb grave robbing, the source of human bodies for scientific learning and research was replaced by the use of unclaimed bodies or the bodies of the working poor and otherwise indigent (see [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Dissection-Destitute-Ruth-Richardson/dp/0226712400) by Richardson.) In other words, it would be assumed that the bodies provided by Holmes (or anyone else in this era) were individuals that were essentially 'forgettable' and expendable to the cause of medical science. Perhaps even worse, there may have been some suspicions that the bodies were those of murder victims, but a short supply of cadavers or skeletons could lead university officials to turn a blind eye to the source of specimens. Universities might have also intentionally kept no records on the source of skeletons to protect themselves from claims of ""body-snatching"" or accepting body parts from murdered people (and likely didn't ask the source, either.) 

Further, universities and/or medical schools at this time did not have a set of universal research ethics or consent procedures for the use of human specimens. It wasn't until after WWII that contemporary clinical ethics truly started to take hold, and people began to voluntarily donate their bodies to science. In other words, faculty and staff in 19th century medical schools did not have the same idea about body donation and respecting the intention of the donor as we do today; they were much more opportunistic when acquiring specimens, and didn't necessarily pay much attention to where the body came from.

which honestly has nothing to do with what they said. They said they liked the other designs better, not that the actual designs sucked. There's nothing wrong with that; they like one art design better than another art design. If you look at it with a blank slate you are more likely to not dismiss it, sure.

I reckon it might even be possible for life to survive or even thrive at higher altitudes, albeit probably limited to microbial at best, if it weren't for the constant radiation bombardment (due to Venus' lack of an Earthlike magnetic field).

11552	"One thing to consider is that the American Congress did not initially support Truman's anti-Communist agenda.  After the war, many still saw the Soviet Union as an American ally--after all, the two nations had just won a world war together.  Another user commented that the fact that Marxism clashed with the values that Americans held dear played the decisive role in the United States' opposition to the Soviet Union after the war.  While it is true that this divergence in values did play a substantial role in the Cold War, remember that the Soviet Union extolled the same Marxist message prior to the war without drawing the same kind of fear from the United States internationally (although the United States did have a prominent First Red Scare domestically after the rise of Bolshevism).  Indeed, the key to understanding the fear that Americans had of communism after the war derived from the fact that the same Soviet Union that seemed impotent on the international stage in the 1920s now looked like the preeminent global threat.  

At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union had an empire forming in Eastern Europe, or at least that's what the soon-to-be-enormously-influential diplomat George Keenan warned in his ""Long Telegram"" sent from Moscow in early 1946.  Keenan warned that the Soviet Union was not a normal world power, that its fundamental philosophy compelled it to continue to try to expand its empire across the globe.  In this telegram, as well as his unclassified followup to the telegram, the widely published ""Article X,"" Keenan argued that the United States had to either ""contain"" communism or else the Soviet Union's grip over Europe and Asia would widen. 

Truman was an early advocate of Keenan's position, and he warned Congress in the wake of Britain's withdrawal from Greece and Turkey that if the Americans did not fund that anti-Communist fighters there, then the Communists would win emerging civil wars in those nations and extend the Soviet Union's power.  But while Congress did fund that initiative, they hesisated when Truman called for further assistance for Western Europe through the creation of NATO and the development of the Marshall Plan (a proposal to spend billions of dollars in order to stimulate the European economy).  Congress hesitated to make such a strong military commitment to Western Europe or to enact a bill that would cost over ten times more than the aid package to Greece.  Then in February of 1948, the Communists instituted a coup (at least from the American perspective) in Czechoslovakia, turning the only parliamentary democracy in the Soviet sphere into another Soviet satellite governed by single-party rule.  This tipped Congress into supporting both of Truman's initiatives.

The year 1949 brought even more fear into the American mind.  The civil war raging in China since the Second World War ended with a Communist victory, seemingly bringing another world power under the control of Stalin and the Soviet Union.  Just two months prior to that, the Soviet Union had detonated its first atomic bomb, ending a nuclear monopoly that American policymakers had hoped to maintain into the 1950s.  This fear compelled the United States to involve itself in its first proxy war against the Soviet Union (or, again, so it seemed to Americans at the time) when it intervened--with UN permission, which is a story in itself--in the Korean War.  The war proved a major setback from the United States, as it drew China into the war and could not win the stalemate that followed.  

All of this may sound terrifying enough, but fear did not peak until the years 1957-1962.  In late 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into space, proving that it had greater rocket technology that the United States and thus the ability to develop an arsenal of atomic weapons that it could deliver across continents to attack the United States without similar retaliation.  This moment spurred the ""Space Race,"" which ended in 1969 when the United States landed a man on the moon.  But well before that could happen, and still in the atmosphere of fear of nuclear annihilation, American intelligence discovered in late 1962 that the Soviet Union had moved nuclear missiles to Cuba.  The ensuing ""Cuban Missile Crisis"" brought the two superpowers to the brink of nuclear war as John Kennedy threatened to attack Cuba if the Soviet Union did not withdraw--a fact followed closely by the American media--until finally the two powers reached a deal that involved the removal of the missiles from Cuba.

Ironically, one of the fundamental fears driving the Cold War--that Communism represented a monolithic force controlled in the center by Moscow--proved to be untrue in the long run.  While the Soviet Union did maintain a high level of influence over Eastern Europe, it did not control the Communists in Greece as the Americans believed, nor in China, in Korea, and in Vietnam.  In each case as Communism spread, local nationalists embraced the philosophy because of its anti-imperialist idealism and because of the substantial support it bestowed on them from Moscow.  By the end of the 1970s, the Sino-Soviet split had already been exploited by Richard Nixon, and two Communist nations, Cambodia and Vietnam, had entered into a war.  By exaggerating the threat that monolithic communism imposed on the United States, American policymakers had helped to create the very bipolarity that they sought to undermine in order to win the Cold War.

11632	I'm gonna go the other direction and say the game has gotten a lot worse since WOG. Shaman is the only class with a powerful aggro deck, Priest and Hunter have been deleted from the game, N'Zoth is obscenely strong, so strong in fact that standard control decks like old school Control Warrior don't exist anymore. Control battles now are all about your big one card tempo-creating win condition that has no drawback. C'Thun, the centerpiece of WOG, is the laziest design for any card I've ever seen in a card game. Reno is too strong. He was fine when the metagame needed him (while Naxx and GVG were still around), but now between Paladin healing and Reno in (potentially) every class, aggro just simply cannot exist, and that's not healthy for the game. Interesting decks don't exist anymore. Everything is about playing strong minions on curve. The only deck that requires an interesting playstyle is Miracle Rogue, because the devs have slaughtered every other interesting win condition that has ever existed since the game's release. I honestly believe the game is going downhill because Blizzard is catering so much towards low- and intermediate-level players and have forgotten about the high-level players, the people who tend to play and master high skillcap decks with unique win conditions.

People are poorer than ever and both governments intend to make us poorer. I can't quite believe that we managed to fuck up 3 votes in a row in the UK, but we did. I think that we're starting to become increasingly aware of just how bad that mistake was. As bad as it is, I think the brexit vote is a small sign of the rebellion of our people.

I think Deir Ezzour is safe and there is still a good chance that PMU's will help lift the seige.

The rebels could very well massacre the villagers and their defenders but that would be a huge political defeat for them and seal their fate.  The only strategic (not moral) reason to help Fua and Kafrya is that it could be a launching pad for further attacks into Idlib, but otherwise it is mostly just a resource suck. The other option is Al-Bab.  Taking Al-Bab would permanently close off the TFSA and make them irrelevant border guards.  Also there are still several pockets around Damascus that need to be dealt with. Relieving Fua and Kafrya would be a huge moral victory and a feather in the cap of the resistance axis narrative.  Al-Bab would be nice but TFSA is no real threat to anything so not much gain there.

12000	"I believe the important thing when reading fantasy novels with multiple perspectives in it is to allow yourself to be comfortable with letting some things slip by and to just go with the flow. For example, if you see a reference to a character or a city/region that you can't exactly remember, then just let it go and keep reading rather than trying to backtrack to find where the character/city/region was initially introduced.

If it is important, then a good author will either explain it to you again without seeming clumsily expository, or you'll eventually figure out what you need from the context, or (if neither of those things occur) then it probably isn't important enough to the story to know anyways.

The Scots are often the target: ""Why do Scots wear kilts? Because sheep can hear zippers."" I have heard a more generic joke/ethnic slur ascribed to Scots, Welsh, Nevadans, New Zealanders, and with apologies, to Australians. This consists of the statement ""[Insert appropriate place]: where men are men and sheep are nervous."" Basque shepherds of the American West are often accused of this sort of thing, and it is not uncommon to hear them referred to as ""Baaasques"" - so that the beginning of the name is made to sound like a sheep.

Insurance companies are picking up on the trend as well. 

We are also working heavily in medication waste, with a reporting mandate on drug waste coming into effect in January 2017. Non compliance would result in no reimbursement and false reporting would result in committing Medicare fraud, which iirc is a $10,000  fine per occurrence (ie, per fraudulent transaction) and comes with a prison sentence as well.

Since these measures haven't been implemented yet, I can't confirm that they will result in cost savings or offsets to programs that will increase government expenses, but [CMS has provided some estimates](https://www.cms.gov/apps/files/aca-savings-report-2012.pdf)."	FALSE

12247	"Great question. The mammalian hippocampus contains something like a cognitive map that enables navigation. Recent work on the sequential firing of so-called place cells in the hippocampus suggest that when in a well-known maze, rats can cognitively sweep ahead, considering one path and then the other, before making a decision about where to go. Such place-cell sequences have even been recorded during sleep and rest, suggesting a neural basis for the learning of the maze layout and its options. Moreover, great apes have been shown to think about hidden movements, and solve some problems through mental rather than physical computation, and show signs of pretense in play and deception. This suggests that they have a basic capacity to imagine alternative mental scenarios of the world. In many ways their abilities are comparable to those of eighteen- to twenty-four-month-old human children. There is little to suggest, though, that they reflect on these imagings (so called meta-representation) and embed them into larger narratives. As a methodological example on how one might assess such capacities, have a look at a recent work by Jon Redshaw and I, in which we gave apes and children the opportunity to prepare for two mutually exclusive future situations. http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(16)30416-X

Now large corporations decide play lists.  In the 1950s, there was a scandal called Payola, where record companies were found bribing radio stations to play music.

It seems that abortion is the #1 or at the very least one of your most important issues. I think the biggest difference between our mindsets is empathy. 

I don't want to make too many assumptions but I'm assuming you are religious? Most-probably white, if not at least born in the US and lived there your entire adult life? I think the environment you live in, it is hard to fathom anyone getting an abortion. And I think that is kind of the problem, it is such a foreign concept to the conservative way of life. It is hard to imagine anyone going through such a procedure. I don't want to be crude, but that is a form of a lack of empathy. And I think that can be attributed to every single difference between my policy positions and yours. I'm assuming you aren't for universal health care, because you should have the liberty to make your own health choices and if you don't want to subsidize other people's healthcare you shouldn't have to. The flip side of that is that I am glad to pay more in taxes if it contributes to the health of the society I live in. If those less fortunate than me are struggling to pay for their healthcare, especially if they have serious health conditions, I'm ok with higher taxes if it helps them. You have said you aren't against LGBTQ which I believe but many conservatives (ex. Cheney) became pro LGBTQ once his daughter was gay. I firmly believe that his position sprouted from a lack of empathy and once the problem affected him he was all for LGBTQ rights. 

Contrary to other comments and the overall political atmosphere I don't think conservatives/Trump supporters are all evil or some giant group of racists/bigots. Rather I think the sole divide between the left and right lies in a lack of empathy. We both want the best for America, but the difference in our policy positions doesn't stem from different interests per se but I think every single major difference solely stems from a lack of empathy.

Moreover, both Russia and Syria reacted to recent Turkish attack against SDF. It will also be good for them if SDF gets closer to Al Bab; that means a good buffer zone between them and Turkish controlled rebels.  

As I said elsewhere, I expect neither Turkey nor SDF to take Al Bab. It seems more likely that SDF's strength will be enough to stand on the way of Turkey, but not to take Al Bab. The latter is not likely because that would mean a total defeat for Erdogan and he would fight very hard to prevent it.

12423	"The Germans didn't aggressively pursue Tanks largely because the need for them wasn't there, and the subsequent debut of Tanks by the Allies was far from promising. Tanks were developed, by the British and French but fielded by the former first, to assist infantry in attacking enemy entrenchments, by crushing barbed wire and destroying machine gun positions with close support fire. They were essentially a response to the particular conditions of the Western Front, where permanent field fortifications, constructed in depth and increasingly more complex by the period 1916-18, presented a formidable obstacle to infantry. Artillery could blast gaps through the wire and demolish strongpoints, but these missions required great accuracy and substantial supplies of shells, and were liable to churn up the ground so terribly as to preclude any deeper exploitation. 

What the Tank appeared to offer was a means of assisting the infantry both in the break-in and break-through phases of an offensive, that avoided the destruction and complex timetables of a thorough artillery plan. Unfortunately, the British attack at Flers-Courcelettes during the Somme Campaign (1916) and the attack on the Chemin des Dames during the Nivelle Offensive (1917) demonstrated the limitations of Tanks. They were loud, very short-ranged and mechanically unreliable to say the least, with most of the Tanks involved in the aforementioned attacks breaking down before seeing action. French tanks initially were very unstable and vulnerable to anti-tank ditches, due to their short and narrow bodies and tracks. Tanks of both armies also required very smooth ground in order to attain speeds greater than walking pace; while the British fire plan at Cambrai in 1917 managed to dispense with a lengthy preliminary bombardment, this also meant that destroying wire and pillboxes and other such emplacements was largely left to infantry, tanks and engineers. If enemy resistance was not hampered by the bombardment, as proved to be the case at Flesquieres, untouched German infantry, mortars, machine guns and light artillery could present a significant obstacle.

The Germans being the defenders in the West, possessed none of the needs of the Franco-British armies that produced the tank. On the Eastern Front, distances over twice that of the Western Front resulted in thinly held lines, in some cases with almost no troops as around the Pripet Marshes. Reserves were held further back, and there were none of the well-developed paved and cobblestone roads, and later networks of light railways, that made movement of troops locally so easy in the West. Once defenders had been exhausted by the attacker, a breakthrough could be exploited fairly easily, or at least significant inroads could be made into enemy territory. The best examples of these are the Brusilov and Gorlice-Tarnow Offensives in 1916 and 1915 respectively, as well as the Battle of Riga and the Tarnopol Counteroffensives of 1917 where the offensive tactics utilized by the Germans in 1918 in the West achieved maturity. 

When the Germans attacked in 1918 in the West, with the so-called Spring Offensives, they possessed sufficient artillery and mortars, supplies of poison gas, and surplus infantry divisions as to make the participation of tanks in their operations completely unnecessary."	FALSE

12462	"A few reasons to use a term like minor attracted person.  First, there are a few different age-orientations: pedophilia is the interest in prepubescent children, hebephilia is the interest in pubescent children, and ephebophilia is the interest in post-pubescent children.  Minor attracted person is a general category that captures all of these age-orientations.  As well, the term 'pedophile' is more harshly stigmatized and is often associated with a lot of negative things in the minds of the lay public.  There is some research supporting the notion that when the term 'pedophile' is used, compared with the term 'sexual interest in children', regular people respond more harshly and have harsher attitudes.  So minor attracted person is an accurate term, but doesn't come along with the same amount of 'baggage' as the term pedophile.  I can see arguments both ways, but that is the logic as far as I can see it and it seems defensible enough.

Original Post:

**USA, EVERY STATE: What is the next step?**
&gt;I am pro se, and I just had a nice conversation with the Judge when I filed my paperwork for some other issues. The topic of My Federal Rule 11 motion came up and the Judge had absolutely no clue what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 11 or its codified statute was. The Judge then said I could NOT serve the other party the motion because they didn't know what it was. This is a JUDGE; and I understand the type of Judge is not used to or maybe never sees any Rule 11 motions (specifically the codified one for the particular state), but what do I do now. This motion NEEDS to be addressed as I KNOW it will reduce the abusive litigation tactics that have been happening. Can someone give me a resource on where I can file this motion if the Judge of the court won't let me serve this appropriately? "	FALSE
12563	"The closest thing I have to a ""one that got away"" is a friend that there was mutual interest with, but I was in a relationship when he was interested in me, and by the time I got out of that relationship and developed an interest in him, he was dating someone else. I think it worked out better that way though, because I think we work better as good friends than we ever would have in a romantic relationship."	FALSE
12564	"You said ""most famous"". Kanye may be a greater artist in your opinion but Beyonce is bigger and more famous. Everything Beyonce does is an event and she doesn't need to go on silly rants on Twitter. She sneezed in her concert recently and there are news articles about it. Also I think you'd be surprised by the impact Beyonce has had on music culture. Of the top of my head, a surprise release will always be referenced to Beyonce because she has had the most successful surprise release ever. Also many pop and rnb singers are inspired by Beyonce.

If your team is rolling them he could be super, likewise then if you're getting hammered it's likely he will just feed kills.

On reflection then he is probably inconsequential to the wins and possibly a factor in the losses.

I've played control point games where a a Bastion has been effective. My team and other team. He is a hero that has such dos capability he warrants respect. But that said Pharah and Genji are both fairly popular picks on control maps so I wouldnt be one to steam in with Bastion off hand. I'd expect to lose to both at least 50% of the time. "	FALSE

12574	Hey guys in the oldschool team. Back in the day when wildy was deleted from the game, we got an exciting pvp place to fill our player killing need. Which was the bounty hunter crater. Even though it wasn't what we wanted from our pvping methods it was still something exciting and new. The more I reminisce upon those days the more I come to realize having the crater actually was a lot of fun. A few of my friends share the same opinion but I don't know about the rest of the community. Would it be possible to poll for the bounty hunter crater not to replace the wildy ofcourse but to return as an additional place for pvping. Ofcourse it would not have to be the same size as the original one as long as it's based on the same concept with the same rules as it did back then. :)	FALSE

Great year from Trent Green, low yardage total but crazy efficient year from Drew Brees, Jake Plummer had an ugly-good year (4k yards in a year where only 5 guys hit that mark, 7.8 Y/A, 27 TDs, 20 INTs) and Kerry Collins for Oakland was poor but not utterly abysmal (3500 yards, 21 TDs, 20 INTs, 6.8 Y/A).

Bledsoe's ""great"" year was less than 3k yards, 6.5 Y/A, 20 TDs, 16 INTs. Pennington was decent but meh (also less than 3k yards, 16 TDs to 9 INTs. Feeley and Fiedler were terribad for Miami, way worse than Collins was for Oakland. Brady was great. Even besides the AFC West I think other divisions were better."	FALSE

So for most crimes, the government has 1/3/5/10 years to prosecute.  Some crimes (in some areas) have no statute of limitations- murder for example has no statute of limitations in my state.

Generally, the more serious the crime, the longer the government has to bring charges.

So you can't get indicted 15 years later for DWI, or possession of drugs, or maybe even burglary or robbery.  So if the crime has a SOL lower than 15 years, then charges could not be brought in the first place.

Then we have to look at how and why the charges were dismissed- there are lots of cases where a dismissal would end the case altogether."	FALSE

Any organization which even peripherally discusses abortion will no longer receive US funding. There aren't a lot of doctors that go abroad completely independently, they do so almost exclusively as a part of NGOs which in turn provide them resources and expertise. The vast majority of those NGOs, such as MSF and the UNFPA, may no longer receive any aid from the US. As a result said aid organizations may be unable to support as many medical staff as they currently do even if most of those volunteers are not volunteering to perform abortions at all. This means less aid workers oversees regardless of their country of origin or even their medical goals.

Its not like the sky is falling, NGOs aren't going anywhere, they just will have to do more with less. As many of pointed out this isn't even a new thing, I wouldn't credit trump too much here as every republican has had the same policy for the last twenty years. It's not some sort of huge win for trump and probably won't devastate the NGOs, its just a return to the Republican status quo.

Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.

Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung,[15][21] the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China for Hong Kong, at that time a British Crown colony.[19]"	FALSE

All else (race, class, location, etc) being equal, then saying ""heterosexual women have easier lives than non-heterosexual women"" is saying that. Unless they live in a wonderful bubble of pro-LGBT equality (which it closely correlated with race and class privilege anyway) then the homosexual women as a demographic have the same issues that heterosexual women do, *and then some extra*.

&gt;I was unclear--didn't mean you were erasing bi people, I meant that when bi women in relationships with men get viewed as straight, that is erasing their sexuality.

Ok. Passing as privileged isn't the same as erasure. When bisexual or fluid individuals are accused of secretly having been hetero all their lives because of who they're with now, *that's* erasure. Simply not being noticed as bisexual or fluid isn't erasure, especially because people who choose to pass (by e.x.: not loudly and constantly proclaiming their sexuality at all times) aren't committing self-erasure.

&gt;It's not. It's a worldview that claims that people are born gay or straight. You're setting up a false dichotomy between ""born this way"" and ""being gay is a choice,"" which are not the only options nor is the second anything like what I described.

There are only two possibilities: either individuals choose their sexuality or they are a particular sexuality without having a choice in the matter. ""Born this way"" doesn't totalize someone fluid into either gay or straight or bi; it means that they were made fluid by their genetics, epigenetics, and developmental environment. Literally no one believes that people are born ""fully formed"" or anything. Everyone grows into who they are.

&gt;I'm not, that's a vast oversimplification of what I'm saying. I said that women could try dating women and they may discover that they're not as heterosexual as they thought they were.

Flip that on its head. Imagine if a man asked a lesbian friend of his ""How do you know you're a lesbian? Maybe you're not as gay as you thought, you should try dick sometime.""

**SO's ex is harassing him under the guise of communicating regarding their child to get around the restraining order in place against her**
&gt;As the title says, my SO's ex has a restraining order in place against her covering him and their child. My SO has primary custody. The restraining order had been amended to allow them to communicate ""regarding the minor child only"". His ex is using this to harass him about the situations that led him to gain primary custody and she is also using it to harass him about his finances and other things. He tells her she's taking it too far and trying to manipulate the restraining order, but she continues doing it. If he amends it to change it back to where she cannot communicate with him, even regarding their child, it will look like he is uncooperative. I've heard this can be a gray area with restraining orders like this. Can he file a complaint through the police for violating the restraining order and abusing the amended portion? Would it be beneficial? He thinks it may be the only way to stop her and I have no idea.

&gt;Newton's base assumptions were wrong. His understanding of what gravity is and what it does is wrong. I'm not understanding how that's simply an incomplete understanding.

This is a naive interpretation of the physics.  In fact neither Newton's or Einstein's model of gravity provides a mechanism, so it's a complete misunderstanding to talk about underlying assumptions being wrong or right.  The idea of space time offers more avenues to test that, but a mechanism of gravity is still lacking. One idea is a gauge boson such as the graviton. Newton was very much correct about his understanding if what gravity does, and except in the extremes his theory is as accurate as Einstein's.  

In science we have degrees of confidence and refinements of truth.  In fact we know that Einstein's theory is incomplete! And it doesn't really describe a mechanism for gravitation. So we say that relativity more closely approximates the truth than Newton's theory.  If I were to describe a parallel with this situation in philosophy it would be if Bob were still trying to develop alternate Euclidean formulae to explain planetary motion.  Physicists would be more or less personally convinced by some of the formulas than others.  Some camps would advocate for Bob,  and others for Newton.

12813	I had 5 classes at 110 on Alliance because all my friends were on Alliance. We recently all went over to Horde which I much prefer, but I didn't want to pay for the transfers so I just made a DH. I find myself really wanting to level a Warrior or Paladin but the idea of leveling another character makes me want to die. It sucks because I have a 100 Warrior on Alliance but have zero interest in playing it.	FALSE

12857	"That is exactly right. China are bent on forcing foreigners and their business to follow Chinese customs or orders. Otherwise you don't even get a chance to expand your business over there. That's why China is the hardest market to get in. 

It's also hard because they've got numbers. If there's something successful oversea (Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, etc), they can just start up their own copycat companies that pretty much do the exact same as the originals'. That rids of the need to allow other worldwide companies like Amazon to get in their market. And that allows China to get ""cocky"" and behave however they want to the point as if they own the place.

A good recent example is how Chinese official shouted and mocked at White House people (and no carpet for Obama on purpose). Their attitude has been getting worse ever since they got some financial power. They like to show off how much they have grown and are not scared of even US every chance they get, no matter how immature or aggressive their way of demonstrating that is. It's just a fact.

Then why do worldwide companies still bow their heads and obediently follow every demand just to get in the Chinese market? 'Cause of numbers. They've got a large ass population that can be their potential customers."	FALSE

&gt; Governments should use tax policy to increase the price of sugary drinks like sodas, sport drinks and even 100 per cent fruit juices as a way to fight obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, the World Health Organisation says.

&gt; Drinking fewer calorific sweet drinks is the best way to curb excessive weight and prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes, although fat and salt in processed foods are also at fault, WHO officials said.

&gt; &amp;quot;This is [a] tax on sugary drinks which is really by definition all types of beverages containing free sugars and this includes soft drinks, fruit drinks, sachet mixes, cordials, energy and sports drinks, flavoured milks, breakfast drinks, even 100 per cent fruit juices,&amp;quot; Dr Waqanivalu said.

Saying she can quit whenever she wants but that she just doesn't want to is also what drug addicts say when people bring up the fact that may need help. This is far beyond insecure, there is a deep issue here and it sounds like professional help is definitely needed. Have you thought about talking to her parents?

12906	"At one point in time I had Frontier internet as it was the only option and was complete shit where I lived. DNS lookups were failing all the time. I added Google as my primary and ta-da, almost all of my issues were resolved. 

Some DNS servers are faster than others and google was the best choice for me. You can also use multiple DNS servers and I believe windows uses whichever is faster for a particular query.

In some cases, countries such as Turkey might ban a particular site (Twitter and YouTube) and Google DNS can be used to get around that ban, at least until ISPs catch one and start intercepting traffic.

Basically like in that ""Phone book"" analogy, an ISP's DNS can be used to reroute traffic headed to blacklisted (for one reason or another) sites. This same method can be used to reroute a failed query to an advertisement. It is kinda like rewriting the phone book so that your business's number pops up instead of the actual business. Google doesn't do that and just gives you a ""DNS address could not be found page""

Can't grow facial hair. About two months without shaving is about the time store clerks will become less likely to ask for ID than just sell me booze, and even then it's a really thin mustache and a pretty disgusting neckbeard. And before you jump to conclusions, no, my hormones are in perfect order - I have like five sets of tests result to prove it too.

&gt;Lift, have visible six pack. Women like it.

I have excess skin from childhood obesity, so it would take an extraordinary amount of muscle for me to *look* fit. To add insult to injury, no matter what I do, I can't bulk. Spent almost four years in the gym, strictly following routines and diets, and still couldn't even bench press 50 kg by the time I quit. Let me reiterate again, that my hormones are in complete order.

&gt;Hair short on sides, long on top. Women like it. 

Not really, not for me. But I did finally figure out a hairstyle that kinda works for me, so there's that.

&gt;Wear Red. Women like it. Or wear dark masculine colors.

Gotta hand it to you - this isn't common advice and it's damn good. Yeah, red and various hues thereof have a pretty big place in my wardrobe. 

&gt;If not tall, wear elevator shoes or lifts. Women wear high heels and make-up, so why not?

Height obsession is really mostly just an American thing. I'm 180 cm, 5.9 in your silly imperial units, and while that's borderline manlet in the US, it's never really been an issue for me. So have some fucking awareness. Your culture really isn't the only one in the world.

For me, I had a really hard time ""getting out there and making friends "". I tried, I just didn't have the same mindset of many people I'd meet. I tried hobbies, games, etc. Finally I simply started singing on a karaoke app because singing has always helped me emotionally.
All of a sudden I started meeting people. I got a lot more followers than I ever imagined I would on ANY social media. They were all so supportive. They made me feel like I was special... They looked forward to singing with me and I them. I made very close friends. We had fun. I can't explain how much it helped my confidence.

Its real problem was that Damien Dahrk made no sense as a villain for Green Arrow. There's no connection between the characters, not even in the comics, and Dahrk's powerset is way beyond what Oliver would be able to handle. Plot armor and/or Dahrk's stupidity and arrogance got him through the entire season. They should have just revived *Constantine*, put Dahrk in that, and given Oliver Anarky or Dusan Al Ghul or someone similar to butt heads with. The escalation from ""guy who wants to corrupt the city"" to ""guy who wants to literally nuke the planet"" was way too much.

So it sounds like it was more about providing an environment where victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, etc. would be able to come to the gym without fear, rather than a nebulous concern about sexualization or judgement.  I can see how the tribunal considered that justified, especially when the argument of the guy complaining was basically that he now only had 10/12 hours that he could come to the gym and that it promoted stereotypes of women as being helpless.  

Oh, and he never proved there was an adverse effect on him, since, well, there were other facilities and the gym in question was still open to him for 10/12 hours anyway.  I'm sure he would have won if he was in a place where there was only a single gym he could get to and/or where the gym barred men completely or most of the time.

13002	"Just curious, because it's something I notice a lot of people leaning towards and I can't figure out why, what is it (besides the ""namesake"" theory that makes you so sure the stolen dragon will be Viserion?
All the foreshadowing points towards the stolen or lost dragon being Drogon, in my opinion, from almost any way you look at it. In terms of power, Drogon is the biggest and strongest and therefore most appealing to any potential theft. An aside from that, Dany's emotional connection is the strongest with Drogon, he's the one she's always thinking about in her chapters and he's the one she has the dragon-dragonrider bond with. In terms of dramatic storytelling, losing Drogon and having to fight him/destroy him/etc is the more impactful scenario. 
If what we learn about dragons from p &amp; q holds true in ASOIAF, Dany wouldn't be able to dragonrider bond with Viserion or Rhaegal, she would essentially be powerless to stop the ensuing dragon battle between them and/or whatever human army Euron throws him at. If Euron steals one of the (for lack of a better term) ""lesser"" dragons, it's far less traumatic and easier to say ""how sad, but it has to be done for the greater good"". Since Dany is most emotionally invested in Drogon, so are the readers by extension. "	FALSE

* In the UK in some areas with high immigration GPs are employing large numbers of translators to handle the number of immigrants who don't speak english etc etc etc

13214	"Sorry for not being compatible being a Muslim living in the UK. My time in the Middle East must surely have radicalised me /s.

It depends on where you look and who you look at. Boring people like me don't usually get covered by the news or any sort of form of media for that matter. 

But we exist. And for the record, I personally dislike being called 'Moderate'. Or some form of watered down Muslim too. It's *because* I know shit about my religion that I'm the way I am. 

If you look in the Qur'an and see a verse about beheading Jews, it's not enough for you to go pick up a cleaver. The Qur'an is not just a book given down the the Prophet (PBUH). It is real-time guidance that encompasses events that take place over a course of 23 years. If you look at a verse, you have to look at the circumstances behind it. You have to look under what conditions does it actually matter. Because there are also verses calling for the Muslims to make peace with the 'People of the Book' (Christians and Jews). Unfortunately, you get people just going with the one that's most convenient to them.

Hell, one single example will give you the example of how the Prophet(PBUH) denounced some of the things the Muslim population don't follow as well as they should that is generally frowned upon. And best of all, it was one of the last things he did in his life. Nearing his passing, he gave the Farewell Sermon. And to list just three of the things in there:
- He explicitly mentioned that women have rights over men and men over women. The point is, is that they are different so they have different needs, but overall they have the same standing in terms of rights. Men are not greater than women, nor woman than men.
- “Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you.” Such a simple lesson, the kind we teach to kids. Yet no-one seems to follow it.
- Equality amongst all people. In every form - including race. This is something deeply rooted not by religion, but by culture (mind-blank, can't think of the right word)
 
That's what the real problem is. There are way too Muslims that don't know their religion. Too many Muslims who have too much pride in the past that they can't live in the present and can't look to the future. I know, it's all around me - both family and friends.

Too many people blaming the West for all their problems. Well, it's leadership anyway. They love everyone of all races and ages. But I always see them blaming the past. The actions of Blair and Bush for example. Yes they are to blame. But the Muslim population is no better for allowing themselves to fall into the mess we've got.

So I can't let you go and say things like that and stay silent. If it sounded more like a rant, I'm sorry. I've just had enough of people saying shit like Islam is incompatible with regular life. I've seen people with more faith than me be far more than just compatible. It's a part of them as it is me.

13230	"**First, I just want to clarify a few facts on the war.** We cannot assume that all or even most of the 20 million who died during the rebellion died from religious fanaticism and war crimes. Many if not most of the human cost of the rebellion came from disease and famine, and much of the violence during the war came from Qing troops' collectivized reprisals and executions against Hakka and other locals tarred as collaborating with the Taiping troops.

Furthermore, the Taiping rebels did not butcher every non-Christian they encountered in Southern China. Few to no records support that claim. They were a fanatical movement, but their primary interaction with peasants on their foraging razzias came from foraging, banditry, and the offer of recruitment (and food) given to the peasants who would convert to Christianity and join the rebellion. Most Chinese peasants who refused to join the Taiping as soldiers, a majority throughout the provinces of Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi, were normally simply left to their fate, to either starve in the countryside, remain on their farms or face violence when Qin troops or local bandits entered their region in strength. 

It is true that targeted genocide did occur during the war, crossing primarily economic and racial lines. The Taiping themselves butchered any Manchu they came across, and simmering economic tension led to massive violence against the favored Han elite in the captured cities. The Qing meanwhile acted incredibly brutally towards their Chinese subjects, targeting the Hakka minority from which the Taiping God Worshipping Movement initially sprung. The result of these policies was massive internal displacement throughout the war, resulting in millions of deaths from famine and underproduction of grain. 

**Amidst all this chaos, the European press was certainly divided** on the subject of who to blame for the war, what to do about the disruption of trade, and how to solve the butchery. 

The vast distance, transport difficulties, and pro-Qin bias of the Shanghai population meant that initially, few Europeans supported the Taiping movement because few to none knew what it even was. However, this does not mean that missionaries or European leaders supported the Qing dynasty. In the midst of the Taiping Rebellion, the Second Opium War erupted, and twice the European gunboat diplomats saw themselves manipulated or ignored by the Emperor in Beijing. The results are obvious: there was little trust and much animosity between the West and the Chinese leadership. Thousands of men died in hostilities between them. This is off track however.

There were several turning points. By 1859, the cousin of Hong Qiuquan, Hong Rengan, entered Taiping Nanjing and became the Shield King, a prime minister of the flagging rebellion. Having lived in Hong Kong for several years, he was in communication with the Western missionaries, and as the rebellion took Suzhou, many Europeans were finally able to learn about the movement. Some became sympathetic towards it. True, there is a striking differentiation between the few missionaries who knew that violence was occurring and justified it as part of God's plan, and the smaller number who went inland and saw the horrific costs firsthand. Nevertheless, many if not most missionaries were sympathetic to the Taiping movement, blaming any 'genocide' not on the rebels, but upon documented Qing reprisals. 

However, as in so many other spheres, political Christianity took a backseat to political economic interests. Merchants involved in the silk and tea trades especially were influential during this period of time in British and French foreign policy. It was their interaction with the local Shanghai Chinese community, especially its refugees and merchant elites, that made them more and more view the Taiping as a horrific cult and dangerous heresy, one that was eventually enshrined in conventional history as the cause of all the horrors and death during the rebellion. This view moreover justified the British intervention of Ward and Gordon on the side of the Qing Dynasty.  

**The rebellion had less of an adverse impact on Chinese Christianity than one would think.** Firstly, the disruption of the Qin dynasty during the 1850s and beyond severely limited its control over the empire. The Qing leadership simply lacked the ability to enforce a religious policy, as most of its troops in the area came from regional militia and European-led detachments such as the Ever Victorious Army. Southern China after the war became in many ways de facto independent, including in regards to its local religious policies. 

As importantly, during the Second Opium War, the victorious Europeans forced the Emperor to implement a new policy demanding religious toleration for non-Taiping Christians. For this and other reasons, Christianity survived in its fashion throughout southern and central China and grew until the advent of Communism. Its adherents were still persecuted of course, but not to the extant that the community diminished. In fact, it is worth remembering that by 1940, the Nationalist leader of China, Chiang Kai Shek, was not born but converted to become Christian. While it may have been a minority faith, it was nonetheless an influential one, especially in coastal China, where interaction with European and American merchants was a larger factor to success than interaction with Qing officialdom.

I highly doubt that a transwoman has the intent of deliberately tricking someone to sleep with her by dressing as a woman.

13341	"I don't think Sauron is supposed to be humanized, although when you learn his ""back story"" he is a bit, but not really... I always thought that one reason he is so terrifying is that he has lost all humanity (again, if he ever really had it...) his corruption of the elves in order to build the orc race shows us that his motivation is power. Hell, he makes the one ring ""to rule them all."" 

I still find him fascinating, and mainly because of how he corrupts those who would otherwise be full of ""humanity."" He exposes within us our fears and hatred, our most crass and (what we often see as our) irreconcilable characteristics. 

I've always seen Sauron as the antithesis of Gandalf (although their powers are almost incomparable). Sauron wants us to turn to hatred, to embrace our prejudices and our darkest desires, to shed that which is good in favor of power, to be corrupted. And I think Sauron forgets that the corrupted do not have to stay that way.

But Gandalf knows that in each of us is good and evil. That we can and do change. When Frodo wants to Kill Gollum, when he says that Gollum ""deserves death,"" Gandalf is quick to point out: ""Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.""

I think that it ought to be obvious that a rational decision maker would not attack the aliens. Aggression is liable to provoke massive overwhelming retaliation at worse and stop the advancement of society at the very best.  Neither a sensible alien-fearer or a sensible alien lover would fight until the other side started it.

So, the question is whether or not enough people and governments would be sensible enough to maintain order. I think that the governments would sue for peace.

It privileges attraction to men either way, ostensibly due to what's basically subconscious misogyny. Could a similar thing be at play here? I'm certainly not saying you're a misogynist, but that this is a part of some larger cultural conception.

I watched their documentary on Netflix the other day and I felt like an idiot for being completely ignorant of their impact on the culture all these years.  
  
For anyone not familiar, they were essentially the stepping stone for any rapper that wanted to make it. Rappers aspired to be on the Stretch &amp; Bobbito show. So many rappers who are now legends appeared on their show before they were ever signed. People like Nas, Big L, Jay-Z, Biggie, Wu-Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes, Big Pun, Fugees, DOOM, etc. were all on their show before they ever saw any sort of fame.  
  
Their show was on from 2-5 am and people would tape their shows to listen to them later. These tapes were often shared around with friends and that's how they got put onto these dope rappers Stretch and Bobbito fucked with. Busta Rhymes said rather than selling drugs, he'd sell tapes of their shows for $5 a tape at school.

*Your first non-kids anime?* I think American fans tend to overestimate the target audience for anime. Does Ronin Warriors count as ""non-kids?"" Sailor Moon? Gundam Wing?

*Your first anime film?* **Pokemon: The First Movie**

*The first you watched in it's entirety from start to finish?* I tend to assume I missed an episode or two of any show I used to watch on TV, but I had seen literally every episode of **Digimon Adventure** in middle school

*The first you dropped?* I remember when Toonami started airing **Sailor Moon S** and I realized that I no longer liked Sailor Moon

*The one that first made you cry or gave you all the feels?* **Pokemon**, the episode Pikachu's Goodbye

*The first you binge watched?* If it counts **FLCL**, if that's too short, then **The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya**

*The first series that made you want to read the source material?* **Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind** maybe?

*Your first anime crush?* **Misty from Pokemon**

*Your first ship?* **Ash and Misty from Pokemon**

*The first [insert your favourite genre] that you watched? e.g. romance/psychological/ fantasy/slice of life etc* I don't really have a favorite genre, but to this day the feeling I most value in anime is the feeling of being deeply touched by a profound piece of art that I had when finishing **Blue Submarine Number 6** (which in retrospect I think I was overvaluing)

*The first one you watched because of the hype?* I mean, technically **Pokemon**? I loved that show in it's own right, unlike **Dragon Ball Z** which I used to watch because my friends liked it and I wanted to be part of the conversation, despite not actually ever liking it myself.

*The first one that took you by surprise?* I have no fucking clue. All the answers to my questions here are Pokemon, and I probably found something in an episode of that show surprising.

*The first that was your ""guilty pleasure"" or you watched in secret?* My friends and I used to have a code word to talk about **Sailor Moon** in public without having people overhear that we were talking about a girl show.

*The first you bought an actual copy of?* I think the first I bought with my own money was **FLCL**

*The first you purchased merchandise for?* **Pokemon** obviously

*The first that gave you PADS? (post anime depression syndrome)* I dunno. I think it might have been **Blue Submarine No. 6**?

*The first anime that you wished there was more of/completed? The first you re-watched?* I was watching **Pokemon** on UPN before it even started airing on Fox Kids. They had a rotation of the first 40 episodes or so, and I knew Japan had seen more episodes and I craved them. The first I rewatched in it's entirety? **FLCL** maybe?

*The first you gave a 10/10?* You're assuming that rating anime has always been a part of the experience for me. When I first compiled a list of all the anime I'd watched it was over a hundred long and I had 5 or 6 10s on it.

*The first to get you hooked on anime as a medium?* I started watching Pokemon and Sailor Moon so close to each other, and that sort of became my understanding that Japan was doing something different with animation than America. I think overall it comes primarily from my friends overstating how censored **Sailor Moon** was for US release."	FALSE

Driving up price only attracts illegal supply which is not only unregulated and thus dangerous but also leads to organization of said crime.

Outlawing Drugs = Cartels and Gang violence
Illegal Prostitution = Human Trafficking Rings

If we were smart, we would invite regulation, collect taxes, and in extreme cases flood the flood market with said items to make the illegal supply effectively worthless.

It's not a matter of morality, just economics and human nature.

13707	"It is indeed exactly the same as light: low-frequency waves which have a wavelength large compared to the size of the dish will undergo ""diffraction"" and not come to a clean focus.

To understand diffraction we need to dispose of straight-line ""geometric ray optics"" and think about sound (or light) as waves.  An important part of this is [Huygens' Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle), which says that when a wave is incident on any point on a surface, it bounces off in *all directions*, spreading out like a spherical bubble as if it were a point source of a new wave.  In some directions, though, this wave energy is cancelled out by [destructive interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation\) ) with waves emitted from other nearby points.

Imagine a plane wave incident on a parabolic dish, and think about what happens when it strikes the two opposite edges of the dish.   The waves emitted from both points travel the same distance to the focus of the parabola, so the waves have a constructive interference and we see a strong signal at the focus.  (In fact, a paraboloid is shaped so that this is true for *every point* on the dish.)

On the other hand, at a point slightly to one side of the focus, off the central axis of the paraboloid, the waves travel slightly different distances from each edge to the point in question, so they will not be in phase when they arrive.  For very short waves, you don't have to go far before the difference in distance is 1/2 wavelength, which will cause *destructive interference*: this means the wave signal is concentrated tightly on the focus, and drops to zero a small distance off-axis.  But for a long wavelength, you have to go sideways much farther to get 1/2 wavelength of travel distance and destructive interference: the signal is spread out over a wider area, and the focus isn't as tight.

It works the same way for waves coming toward the dish from different directions: for short wavelengths, the dish will lead to constructive interference only for rays nearly parallel to the centerline; for long wavelengths, a wider range of incident angles will do, so the dish is less directional.

&gt; I can understand that parabolic dishes are transparent to light whose wavelength is bigger than the diameter of the dish.

This is not true: where the light strikes the dish, it will be reflected.  If there's empty space on all sides of the dish, though, the light that passes to either side of the dish will diffract in to fill in the ""shadow"" behind it.  If the dish is enclosed in a tube, as in your thought experiment, that won't happen.

&gt; Imagine a long cylindrical tube and a reflective parabolic dish of the same diameter placed in the middle of the tube. The dish fits perfectly into the tube. A plane sound wave whose wavelength is bigger than the diameter of the dish is emitted at one end of the tube. Does the dish focus the wave? The sound has nowhere else to go and the dish is reflective. What happens to the wave? The energy cannot disappear.

Whether the wavelength is large or small, the wave will be bounced back toward the entrance of the tube.  What will change is *how much of that energy passes through the focal point along the way*.  For a wavelength much bigger than the dish, the dish will behave almost like a flat disk: plane wave comes in, plane wave bounces back out, no focusing action at all.

13709	How is it considered spearphishing to know your target's name? That could have easily been obtained from employee directories and the like, and mass generated with a mail merge program. Being in the industry myself, and having met tons of underground hackers and even members of anonymous, I can tell you many of these underground hackers really do run circles around most corporate netsec employees because they are geniuses at what they do and are motivated by passion and a mission, not money. Even back when the NBC leaks happened and everyone blamed it with certainty on North Korea, I had personal experience with people in the community who were 100% certain this was an independent hacking group doing it for glory and nothing more. Why can't this be the same case? These aren't stuxnet level actors...its a goddamn Gmail copy paste phishing email which only has the target's first name.	FALSE
13710	"The complication is that I was always told that I was smart when growing up and I got into a prestigious school when I was 12. Everyone else there had studied VERY hard to get in and had already formed their own study schedule etc. And there was me, who only relied on the night before studying. Now, the difference wasn't very obvious when we were younger but now at 17, I am the bottom of the cohort now. Whether it is due to harder subjects or brain cells dying off thanks to lack of sleep and unhealthy lifestyle ( as ridiculous as it sounds ), I developed the mindset that I was inferior, I was stupid.

For the previous exam, I put in 15hours/day of studying for two months. I had 7th percentile and 10th percentile for the two subjects I spent the most time on,  16th percentile for the subject I decided to ""sacrifice"" and not study at all. As I have roughly a month to catch up on a year's worth for 5 subjects, I really have to find a plan to make this happen. The problem is not the lack of studying/discipline ( I admit I do lack discipline on a daily basis but using the above as a case study ) but rather, the interference by my mindset as well as not knowing how to study smart/time efficient.

As for the advice you gave on finances, perhaps it is because I don't know much about it but it seems simple enough as it is. :) I don't have to pay taxes -yet-. I have an ongoing graded project so around this weekend, I will be contacting possible jobs prospects."	FALSE

Things like this are what make sports awesome in my opinion, it's why TNT will always be 100 times better than ESPN who don't even show player introductions in the NBA finals anymore (stopped after 2014) for some unknown reason (probably to show more commercials and get more money). I was super bummed about that.

You seem to have accepted their validity yourself for those particular places, so let's not pretend that the data we have aren't good enough. You can't just redefine ""sample size"" whenever you want to challenge someone on it (also, sample size challenges are the lazy contrarian's MO, so use that strategy sparingly). 

If you mean that these are two example economies, well that isn't terribly problematic either (unless you just want it to be). For one thing, we don't have any counter examples, meaning that so far this has been the case everywhere we've checked. It would be nice to have more certainly, but we have enough evidence to draw a tentative conclusion.

&gt;What you would get instead is just a lot more horsetrading and deal-making.

Is this necessarily a bad thing?  In our current system the governing party has a ton of power and is not accountable to anyone.  How is more diplomacy between parties a bad thing?

Finding a job is hard honestly, but don't let that alone get you down. It took me awhile to find one, and even when I did, it was shitty. That's just part of being young, sadly.

Because context matters.

It's one thing to have a reasoned discussion about US intervention and reevaluating our use of extrajudicial killings abroad.  That's a conversation worth having.  It's something *altogether different* for the so-called president of the United States to defend Vladimir Putin by saying ""he's not a bad guy for murdering political opponents and dissidents because we do it too.""  ""Whataboutism"" is literally a Soviet propaganda technique, and the president of the fucking United States is employing it to deflect criticism of Vladimir Putin.  I don't know how it's possible for someone to honestly not see why Trump's comment was problematic."	FALSE

All note 7 owners there could trade for the s7/edge and when the note 8 releases it'll be half price for anyone who bought the note 7. They'll probably do the same here atleast I'm hoping they do  since I'm going back to my note 4 until the 8 is out. The note phones are the only ones for me.	FALSE
13885	"Rhaegar **was** antisocial. This dude was noted to be a loner who had his father's knights all making fun of him and of his efforts at being a knight up until he proved himself. And even then, that whole statement about how ""no one really knew Rhaegar Targaryen"" kinda suggests that he still wasn't seen as that much of an accessible guy. Add in that whole deal about him preferring to spend weeks and months at a time alone at Summerhall. All that put together doesn't just suggest antisocial; it practically screams it.

Throw in all those instances where he doesn't seem to really care about the bad things that are happening around him (that he's at least partly responsible for, no less), and Rhaegar most certainly comes off as a sociopath.

(Not that popularity has anything to do with someone's ability, or lack of ability, to truly care about other people. Hell, Caligula was known to be wildly popular at the beginning of his reign, and that guy's pretty much the poster boy for the word ""sociopath"". In fact, being able to successfully fake feelings to the point where people who you couldn't give a crap about have positive opinions of you and the image you project is one of the things that makes sociopaths so potentially dangerous to begin with)

P.S: And nothing about Lyanna being pregnant should prevent her or anyone with her from sending notes and letters to Ned while the war is going on, if only to give her side of the story and/or try to prevent things from escalating. Unless, of course, what she had to say would not reflect well on the people responsible for keeping her in the situation she's in at all. Or she fell so deep into the Stockholm Syndrome that she didn't know up from down anymore regarding who loved her and who didn't, which would be terrible and a hell of a sin to put on Rhaegar's head all on it's own..."

13888	"""Bush, search party of three. You can up-vote when you find the Dufranes."""	FALSE
13889	The problem regarding Raqqa is that ISIS is attempting to consolidate their remaining hardpower in Deir-Ez-Zor, which is Raqqa's backyard. If Deir-Ez-Zor falls, ISIS will be able to fortify their defenses in Raqqa to a level that the Kurds will have a much more difficult and costly time trying to penetrate. Besides preventing that, liberating Deir-Ez-Zor would give the Kurds the advantage of going *up* to Raqqa along the Euphrates, significantly hindering ISIS's supply lines into Raqqa, and increasing the chances of a successful encirclement of Raqqa that ISIS will not be able to break out of.  	FALSE
13890	 Do you really trust the government to pick which drugs to subsidize? Do you think bureaucracy moves at the same speed as enterprise? Do you *honestly* trust *elected officials* to determine which drugs are tested? The people with no scientific or corporate backgrounds? Who are *easily bribed and influenced*?	FALSE

As /u/RalesBlasband pointed out below, you must first give your landlord a reasonable amount of time to remedy the issue. ""Reasonable"" usually means ""about the same amount of time as it would take an average contractor to come do the job"". There's no hard and fast rule, it's just a matter of what the judge (if it goes that far) finds reasonable.

A week, unfortunately, is not unreasonable, especially if the landlord is dealing with emergency repairs elsewhere, or waiting for a part, or uncovered more substantial issues (rotting window / floor / support frame, etc).

Continue contacting the landlord at reasonable intervals. If this goes on another few weeks, consider sending a certified letter formally requesting the repairs. Keep it short, no more than 3-5 sentences. Certified letters tend to get peoples' attention, and at about $6 a pop, they can be a cheap and effective tool to resolving most issues."	FALSE

&gt; Effective climate change legislation

We already have this, because a lot of Canadians believe a mild revenue neutral carbon tax is in fact ""effective climate change"". If we go to either side of this stance, we find...

* a lot of people who believe that whatever Trump is about to do will be ""effective climate change legislation""
* a few people who want high levels of carbon tax

So, averaging those out, which is what PR would do, we end up with a policy that looks...a lot like what we already have, through FPTP. Possibly, the PR version would be even weaker, as there are more Canadians out there who want *less* than what we're doing, then there are Canadians who want *more*.

What the heck, this is fun, let's take another one...

All indications are that a vast majority of Canadians are comfortable with what we have. Explain how PR will take us from where we are - which is supported by a large majority - to ""full rights"" - which is only supported by a small minority.

It does not, and indeed cannot, include cases of rape which go unreported or unrecorded.[137][303] It does not specify whether recorded means reported, brought to trial, or convicted. Each entry is based on that country's definition of rape, which varies widely throughout the world.

**Definition of rape in India**

&gt;§375. A man is said to commit ""rape"" if he:–– 

&gt;(a) penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or 

&gt;(b) inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the penis, into the vagina, the urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or 

&gt;(c) manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus or any part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or 

&gt;(d) applies his mouth to the vagina, anus, urethra of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person, under the circumstances falling under any of the following seven descriptions:

&gt;Firstly.–– Against her will.

&gt;Secondly. –– Without her consent.

&gt;Thirdly. –– With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested, in fear of death or of hurt.

&gt;Fourthly. –– With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married.

&gt;Fifthly.–– With her consent when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or unwholesome Substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent.

&gt;Sixthly. –– With or without her consent, when she is under eighteen years of age.

&gt;Seventhly. –– When she is unable to communicate consent.

&gt;Explanation 1.–– For the purposes of this section, ""vagina"" shall also include labia majora.

&gt;Explanation 2.–– Consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement when the woman by words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication, communicates willingness to participate in the specific sexual act;

&gt;Provided that a woman who does not physically resist to the act of penetration shall not by the reason only of that fact, be regarded as consenting to the sexual activity. Exceptions –– 1. A medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape; 2. Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.

&gt;Article 376B of the 2013 law made forced sexual intercourse by a man with his wife – if she is living separately – a crime, whether under a decree of separation or otherwise, punishable with at least a 2-year prison term.[14] Forced sex by a man on his wife may also be considered a prosecutable domestic violence under other sections of Indian penal code.

&gt;All sexual acts between the members of the same sex, consensual or forced, remains a crime under Section 377 of Indian penal code, after the 2013 Criminal Law reform, with punishment same as that of rape.

**Definition of Rape in USA**

&gt;In the United States, at the Federal level, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) definitions are used when collating national crime statistics from states across the US. The UCR's definition of rape was changed on January 1, 2013 to remove the requirement of force against a female and to include a wider range of types of penetration.[1]

&gt; The new definition reads:


&gt;Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.

Soruce: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_United_States


**Under reporting**

I choose not to include this statistic as it varies wildly by source. Various outlets reporting somewhere around 60% and others reporting high as 90% for India. For the US the range varried from 15.8% to 35% reported. But other sources reporting higher numbers.

This make sense—he reveals a door, and we imagine everyone is tense as he does so, wondering whether the revealed door will be a car or a goat.  Will this be the end? Then, a collective sigh of relief as the door ends up being just a goat, so we're still in the game!  That just seems like how a game show would work—drama!

But it's *not* how it works, and the entire problem hinges on it.  The host is *deliberately* revealing a non-car door.  He **knows** where the car is, and he's avoiding it *on purpose.*  I'm not sure what the point of this part of the show is supposed to be, then—seeing as there's no uncertainty or drama to such a predetermined 'revelation'—but that's how it works, and it's critical that it work that way for the 'problem' to arise.

*Because* that's how it works, we end up choosing from three potential options before the reveal, and two after it, making swapping the obvious choice.  If it were instead actually random, it would *not* be meaningful to switch. but it's not random, so it is meaningful.

The only reason this is a counter-intuitive result is because we are disinclined to believe a game-show would work that way, and the people presenting the problem avoid making it clear.  The trick is nothing counter-intuitive about math, it's simply poor communication about the situation."	FALSE

How exactly is the father-in-law of the King, the Hand of the King and the most powerful man alive in the series incompetent? 

He is one of the most successful Lords we have seen in the series. It is stretching textual reality to call him incompetent. 


&gt; Tyrells don't remain strong because of any intelligence on his part.

He is the leader of his House, as Olenna points out he made the decisions. The decisions that have made them the most powerful House in the realm. 


&gt;  They're strong because they're naturally strong

They are stronger now then they were at the start of the series. Infact history has shown that they have not even been the traditionally strongest House in the Reach under Targ ruler, that has been the Hightowers. 

Under Mace's helm they have grown pretty strong


&gt;  but Mace's actions have put one of his kids in prison

lol briefly in prison, quickly released. 

If that makes Mace incompetent then what does that make Tywin and Ned?

Not sure what Brieene has to do with this

&gt;  He's tied himself to a sinking ship.

Seriously, this is grasping. Aegon being alive and Dany possibly returning with Dragons and an huge army was not exactly common knowledge when he made his decision. 

Ambition does not equal buffoonery or incompetency. 

&gt; Tyrion doesn't call a lot of people stupid but his words and actions imply that he thinks they are. 

You have failed to show any evidence of Tyrion implying Mace was stupid. He even notes how Mace is benefiting more than anyone's else when the lands are being carved up.

And then there is the fact that Tyrion fails to see the importance of Sansa's hand in marriage while Mace does. 

&gt; Hand to a boy king whose ship is sinking, father of a queen in jail and he has he has the largest army because the Reach inherently has the largest army. That's no feat on his part. And no it doesn't seem like he has control of the Small Council. Mercy implies that Cersei is back in control.

14228	"It's one of those ugly infrastructure games. The only way to do it right is trenching and do underground services. Got sidewalks and concrete? Holy crap that just added a zero or two to the bill.

Even if you don't go for a proper level 2 charger (couple of grand EACH), getting a 120v or 240v outlet means that you had some serious costs to equip every slot.  Credit card swipe station at every plug in box? In order to make that robust and survive cold winters that thing needs to be built super sturdy and very expensive. So now we need power and ethernet at every charging slot. Cheaper than cellular if you are doing every terminal and already pulling cable. Power source? We need to tie into a nearby utility pole. So the power company wants a small chunk of change (lease) for you to mount a meter box on it.

You need to amortize the install over several years or and you need payback on investment and enough revenue to fund maintenance and repairs.  Plugs wear out and crack heads steal copper. We need an office full of people to deal with credit card processing. We need another floor of people just to manage the continuous construction crews and a third just to deal with bullshit paperwork to do with permits and the city. That many people need an HR department and full time OSHA/health and safety guy too. If you have ever built public works projects before, you will quickly understand how the city loves to do nothing but charge fees and waste time here.

Let's assume the city gives you the land to put your chargers on for free for the first 10 years then charges you 20% of the take from there on. We can ignore that as our capital costs will have paid off by then.

So, let's see here. The bill (including all staffing costs, road construction crew, concrete, asphalt, equipment, wiring, electricians, permits etc) to put in charging stations all the way down one sidewalk equipped block was $146,000. And that is one block of a whole city. The answer is probably some public-private partnership. How do they get paid back? Really high markups on charging slots. 

The utilization rate will be maybe 50% for one full charge a day if you are lucky. So now our business model needs to pay back that investment, and a payback of 5-8 years would be reasonable for that kind of capital investment and risk. All of a sudden it costs you far more in fees than power to charge your car.

14240	"So every culture that has ever existed has their own incest taboos, and there is a lot of interesting scientific data that points towards why this exists. One of the more interesting ones is the [body odor smell test for mate preferences](http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/9/1269.full), and it showed that body odor is a major factor in mate attraction, and that we all detect our partners immune system from how  they smell. The better the smell the more different there is in the two individuals immune system. This implying that any child between the two with the most different immune systems would have a stronger immune system.  But they did blind trials and were able to slip odors of siblings and relatives in and found by far these were rated as the most disgusting smells to all the participants in this test. This has been repeated over and over again with the same results. 

This implies that there is a natural evolved disgust to incest in humans, so that kinda backs up the the first argument and talks about the second and third one. The main risk of incest isn't just deformity its more that you are drastically weakening the immune system of all further generations of the children to come from that line.

I agree.  I have the (MITM) capability, but have never needed (or even wanted) to use it.  The organizational policies allow for reasonable personal use, but we don't really even monitor that.

&gt; and scan the actual content of TLS traffic

To be fair, there is a lot of information one can gather without needing to look into the SSL traffic; just the way it is set up is enough to determine a lot of what is going on.  One doesn't need DPI to figure out, for example, which VPN software someone is running over port 443.

If I print out a computer program on sheets of paper. Obviously it isn't thinking. So maybe it is when I put the program into the machine and start the *process* that thinking happens? I agree with this! That can be called thinking! But it cannot be called consciousness!

If it could be called consciousness then that would apply the same to humans! Meaning we could develop some way to parse whatever the 'consciousness' program of a human is into a computer language, feed that into a machine, and then we'd suddenly have a conscious machine. It would suggest there's only a difference in degree between the program of ""Me"" and the program of Tetris. But this is absurd, there must be a difference in kind.

14348	"I'm an engineer-turned-SAHM.  My spouse and I had paid down debt and organized our finances so that it would be possible for us to live off one income once we had children (just in case that's what we decided to do).  When we were pregnant with our eldest, we were both commuting 1+ hr each way for work.  We discussed having split schedules (lots of driving to work fewer hours), hiring a nanny (working just to pay someone else to raise our child whom we wouldn't see as often), and one of us staying home.  When we discussed which one of us could/should stay home, my spouse had an advanced degree (more possibility for career advancement) and, when thinking of staying home rattled off a number of projects he'd like to work on, none of which was changing diapers or cleaning up spit up, or doing endless loads of laundry.

I have now ""been home"" for 15 years.  There are definite plusses and minuses.  My spouse has *never* missed a day of work to care for one of our children, has been able to focus fully on work projects, and has been able to go on last-minute business travel and stay late for meetings.  We have traveled cross-country for his work without needing to work around any job of mine.  Our kids have always had at least one parent available for school concerts, to volunteer at school, to drive them to/from extracurricular activities, and to take them to doctor's appointments.  They come home from school to a house where there is an adult to keep an eye on them and help them out with homework.

On the negative side, my work experience and references are woefully out-of-date.  We presently live in an area (for my spouses's job) where there isn't any work for me.  I would need to go back to school to get additional certification to be able to get into a career... At the same time we're preparing to send our kids off to college ($$$).

I suspect our family would also have difficulty changing our lifestyle, at this point... Homemade meals most every night, kids being able to participate in in every activity without worry (no public transportation here), etc...

On the money front:  My spouse's income has doubled in the fifteen years I've been home.  Some portion of that may be due to his ability to dedicate himself to his work.

Also, if I worked, the first dollar I made would be taxed at our highest tax rate.  Assuming a 25% federal tax, 6% state ta, SSI, and medicare, that's almost 40% of every dollar.  When the kids were younger, child care costs would have been several hundred dollars per month.  We likely would have higher bills for convenience items like fast food and weekly housekeeping.

If I'm working when my kids are heading to college, FAFSA will attribute about half my income toward our Estimated Family Contribution.  

So,roughly 40% on taxes, 50% on college EFC, and I get 10 cents for every dollar....

We have a decent income.  But we've also been fairly frugal.  We've largely found that we can live well if by ""well"" you mean ""food in our stomachs, a roof over our heads, medical care, and something put aside for college and retirement"".  We have never owned a luxury automobile, a boat, a flashy diamond ring, gone on exotic world travels, put our kids in private school...  I don't feel any the poorer for it.

14353	"People here are giving you examples of why calling something socialist doesn't make it socialist, but not explaining *why* the USSR wasn't socialist, so I'll help you out. Socialism in its most basic definition, is when workers are in control of industry, who we call the Proletariat. Capitalism is when an elite class controls industry, who we call the Bourgeoisie. The USSR can't be considered socialist, according to many leftists and political philosophers, because the Communist Party was in control of industry in the USSR, not the workers. That's why many people call it *state* capitalism, because an elite class controlled industry, they just happened to control government directly. The US and Europe have private capitalism, where private individuals control industry, or capital. The Communist Party was practically an aristocracy in the Soviet Union. If you're looking for an actual socialist system, I would check out Yugoslavia in the 60s, the Ukrainian Free State, and Anarchist Catalonia. Those all, imo, meet the definition for socialism.

EDIT: I'd also like to clarify, the Soviet Union wasn't technically communist either. Communism refers to a stateless, moneyless, classless society. And most are well aware that the USSR was a state that used currency and developed classes. When people talk in general about communist countries, they typically mean Marxist-Leninist countries. I'm personally okay with people calling the USSR and China communist, because no communist system has ever (imo) been established, and its become so ingrained that its not really worth asking people to use the academic definition."

&gt;Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production; as well as the political ideologies, theories, and movements that aim at their establishment.

Although there are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them, social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms.

Also if Musk can show the sat business makes money, or will make money, he can sell it off to say Google and take the profits from that sale to fund his Mars program without having to wait till the sat program develops the money though normal commerce.

He could, as it came through the crack, kill it. It was alive, terribly mortal: the ad agencies, like nature, squandered hordes of them.

I think they are probably anti-slavery and possibly anti-dragon because of their connection to Braavos which was established by escaped slaves of Valyria.   Jaqen may have been attempting to visit the Winterfell library for a rare book on dragons which would explain why he was on the way North before heading to Oldtown (assuming he wasn't imprisoned in the black cells against his will).  It's also theorized that the faceless men accepted a dragon egg as payment from Euron.  Arya's spying in Braavos suggests they are interested in the politics of Braavos which I think further suggests they aren't just neutrals or just trying to obtain money. 

These things hint that they have some unknown goal rather than just follow the many-faced god's will or simply kill for money.  I'm sure they rationalize it by saying accomplishing whatever goal they have is the will of the many-faced god, but I think they are just another faction with their own goals for power in mind just like every other group in Westeros and Essos.

NASA gets to concentrate on other great things in the future, like mining asteroids. This is really what NASA should be concentrating their efforts on, because it actually has a direct benefit to the US and mankind in general. You could argue that climate science does too, but the reality is that (useful) climate research will not change long term, even though it will be a bit disrupted for now. I think we have a lot of time to figure the climate out - the vast majority of the damage to our atmosphere is already done too.

14574	"I don't know about how it all started.  But looking back on some discussions of grading from about 100 years ago, we might get some clues about why a 5-point system has been so common.  This comes from the works of several scholars who were writing about grading around 1908-1913:  Dearborn at Wisconsin, Finkelstein at Cornell, and Meyer at Missouri.   

They wrote about how letter grades were supposed to be distributed, and explored on their campuses what was happening in practice.   One of the justifications for a five-point scheme is the idea that students (or, students' performance, or students' attainment) should be distributed along a relatively normal curve, and that a five-division system is sufficient to differentiate students in such a fashion.  So, most kids get C's (which are, in this sense, average).

The other justification for having a small number of categories (like 5) helps ensure reliability.  That is, if you had a 100-pt grading scale, and asked a number of evaluators to grade a paper or exam, they might deviate in their grading--you might give it a 75, I might give it an 79, the notoriously tough moderators here give it a 71.  But if we had to assign a letter grade, we'd all land on C.  And reliability in grading is a desirable thing within and between schools.

I don't know why A, B, C became standard, but it wouldn't surprise me to hear that it was no more complicated than just starting with the first letter of the alphabet and going through the first 5.  Why ""E"" became ""F"" is another question, can't answer it, could speculate but don't want to get dinged.

Now, you can easily attack the premise that grades are distributed normally, and you can also attack the premise that grades are distributed reliably.  But *theoretically* these seemed to be the key argument for this kind of division of grades. "	FALSE

Not only do you have more than one cause (sugar, too many calories, not enough movement, etc) but you also have more than one outcome (diabetes, heart disease, colon cancer etc.) In order for the campaign to be effective, I think it would have to get much simpler. Drinking soda will kill you. Eating skittles will kill you.

Now combine the difficulty in messaging with the immense power of the lobbies you are fighting against. The Tobacco lobby was big, but now your talking about the farm lobby, the beverage lobby, etc. There are super enormous, politically powerful groups, I think even more so than the Tobacco companies were.

&gt;How does Ghostbusters (2016) existence take away from your love/enjoyment of the original?

I don't think it takes away your enjoyment, but it can have a negative effect on the series/franchise or something you like about it. If it fails then it might miss out on further expansion.

I haven't seen the new Ghostbusters so i'll use two other examples. First Star Wars, as a fan of the old EU books the new films cut off any further expansion of those characters and their stories. A new direction will be set by the new films and while I can still enjoy it it's probably a net loss for my enjoyment. 

Another is The Hobbit, the LOTR trilogy was masterful in so many ways. It showed that CG, minatures, costumes and simple optical illusions could be stitched together and created a really great version for film. The Hobbit didn't meet those same standards and what are the chances anyone will make another movie based on the book in the next 20-30 years?

3. TANK another further south of that location near some buildings.

a) The pop sound was local to the fire practice area if it shows up only on the FIRE sensors, or not at all

b) If not, though triangulation, roughly where any such pop was. 

If all three of these sensors detected the rocket fast fire, it should be feasible to **roughly** triangulate any external pop sound or other sound they detect via the difference in relative timing that the pop appears on each once they are aligned at the initial blast. Or if they all have the exact same relative timing, it implies the source was the pad.

Wrong.  Don't lie.  Barack Sr. was BORN into a Muslim family, attended a Christian missionary school in Kenya, converted to Anglicanism when he was six years. which is when he changed his birth name from Baraka to Barack.

Source:  [The Other Barack: The Bold and Reckless Life of President Obama's Father](https://books.google.com/books?id=avVDwQk8l-8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

&gt;""Her brother Baraka, as she [Hawa Auma] recalls, converted to Christianity when he was about six years old and changed his name to the more Christian-sounding Barack because the Christian missionaries at the early schools that he attended insisted that he do so."" -Pg. 26

He even stood up to his father to insist that he was Christian and not Muslim, when he was six.  It's disgusting how wrong you are.  And later in his life, when he met President Obama's mother, he became an atheist.

Here's a list of all the proof that President Obama (who's father was an Anglican and then aetheist) is not a Muslim, from Conservapedia (I hope that's unbiased enough for you) 

http://www.conservapedia.com/Counterexamples_to_Obama_being_a_Muslim#Obama_and_the_month_of_Ramadan

And you realize that Obama has been attending a Church in Chicago forever, right?  Ever heard of Reverend Jeremiah Wright?  You have serious mental issues if you think he's a Muslim.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/chain-email/not-a-muslim-not-mohammed/

&gt;I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church.

&gt;So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.

&gt;And I think also understanding that Jesus Christ dying for my sins spoke to the humility we all have to have as human beings, that we're sinful and we're flawed and we make mistakes, and that we achieve salvation through the grace of God. But what we can do, as flawed as we are, is still see God in other people and do our best to help them find their own grace.

&gt;That's what I strive to do. That's what I pray to do every day. I think my public service is part of that effort to express my Christian faith.

14685	"The foundation myth of Carthage, though only preserved in late sources, tells us that a certain ""Dido"" fled Phoenicia in ships laden with her slain husband's hoard of gold, and that she settled in North Africa to found a new city (Carthage, Kardt-Hadash, means ""New City"" in Phoenician).  We have no idea if this story has any sort of historical veracity to it, but it does bring up a valid point: there were many reasons that people(s) were moving around in that period, and not all of them concerned ""colonies"" and ""homelands.""  We don't know for sure what exactly the Phoenicians were up to in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE, but I am fairly confident that it looked very different than British colonial behaviors two millennia later.  

Personally I think the Phoenicians went west in search of raw materials, especially precious metals.  The peoples of the Levant had inherited a long tradition of artisan metalworking, and were the masters of turning raw silver and gold into elaborate pieces for resale.  In particular, the Phoenicians were very good at [granulation techniques](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/gold-bracelet-made-up-of-5-embossed-and-granulated-plates-news-photo/118121950#gold-bracelet-made-up-of-5-embossed-and-granulated-plates-with-a-picture-id118121950) by which they decorated pieces with tiny dollops of molten gold.  In pursuit of metals, then, they went ... where the sources of raw metal were.  That meant Cyprus, initially, where they had a major settlement at Kition.  Beyond Cyprus, that meant a few juicy spots in Greece, all of which had occupants who probably proved to be less than cooperative.  They probably then went further afield, drawing on knowledge of the central and western Med. that stretched back into the Bronze Age.  That meant southwestern Spain, where they founded a port at Gadir (Cadiz). That meant Andalusia, Sardinia, Sicily, and northern central Italy.  In all of these places, there is pretty clear evidence that they interacted with ""the locals"" (Iron Age Iberian tribes; Etruscans; Sicels; etc) in order to work out deals for extraction.  In SW Spain, it was via Gadir and via smaller, ""emporion""-style enclaves like that of Castillo de Dona Blanca.  In Andalusia, it was a string of small, coastal settlements which seemed to serve as an interface for the extraction of materials from the unexplored interior (Toscanos, e.g.).  In Sardinia, there were several large settlements from early on in the 8th century, including Tharros (from which the image linked above comes).  In Italy, there are no adjacent settlements (that we've found), so they must have relied on a different model: routine visits to Etruscan cities, for instance, or perhaps use of a common meeting ground like Pithekoussai(?).

Recent scholarship suggests that Carthage, from the get-go, was a sort of centralized clearing house for the movement of materials back and forth, and rather quickly outgrew the importance of the ""homeland"" as a hub for the reception, working, and re-export of Phoenician products.  We can trace the creative output of Carthage workshops and find ""Carthaginian"" vs ""Phoenician"" wares in the west as early as the end of the 8th century.  We don't know what relationships existed between the west and the Levant, or Carthage and Tyre/Sidon, though by the 6th century it didn't matter, because the Phoenician ""homeland"" had been conquered and Carthage was left as the new de facto capital of Phoenician (now ""Punic"") interests."

Styles are a cool concept in theory but in practice they're pretty terribly balanced. Guild is the same old, nothing really to say there. Adept is either stupid good on certain weapons (LS, Hammer, Bow) or stupid pointless on other weapons (GS). I personally prefer Guild SA, but Striker SA loses pretty much nothing compared to its Guild moveset and has some of the best Arts (I don't play SnS but I hear it's the same) while Striker completely neuters other weapons like IG. I hate Aerial on any weapon - the jumpy-dodge roll feels clunky as shit, it's spammy as fuck, and I've always hated mounting anyways. I wouldn't mind if they kept Styles in future games, but they really do need to tweak a ton of things so each Style is decent on each weapon. If not, there's always Guild Style.

Arts... eh. I never really found any of them to be super interesting. The only ones that had any real impact on gameplay for me were SA's Energy Charge and Demon Riot since those gave infinite sword mode (seriously, fucking tone down sword mode and buff axe mode already). Some like LS's Sakura Slash or IG's Extract Hunter were convenient at times but I wouldn't really miss them if they were gone. Absolute Evade/Readiness are pretty much safety nets, but personally I already knew most of these monsters well enough that they weren't too useful; although Readiness restoring sharpness is again, a convenience that's nice to have but I wouldn't miss too much if it were gone. Keep Arts in future games or remove Arts from future games, I don't really care either way.

I'm sure there's a ton of people bitching how Styles and Arts make the game too easy, but honestly, nothing is stopping you from just going Guild without any Arts and pretending it's MH3/4U. Or if you want to go even further, go Striker without any Arts and pretend you're playing MH1/2. I'm also sure some people would go as far to claim that others using certain style/arts in multiplayer somehow ruins their experience, but obviously everything's going to be easy as hell in a group compared to soloing.

Being able to play as a Palico was a neat idea and was indeed neat at first but I soon started to dislike how they play. The existence of ""Palico only"" quests is just plain dumb; what if they had introduced ""CB only"" quests or ""IG only"" quests in MH4U? I'm sure they want players to actually try out Prowler mode, but really in practice it's just a new weapon type and is even treated as such according to your weapon usage records.

Deviants were a cool idea but in practice they're tedious as fuck since you constantly have to unlock the next level of the hunt. It's even worse when you actually want to craft their respective armors, since then you'd have to run each level at least 3 times for a single set of armor. Still better than MH4U's awful Expedition + Guild Quest system though. I also disliked the selection of monsters that got chosen to get a Deviant version; who the fuck wants to hunt Deviant Hermitaur or Lagombi? And of course the bland ass Raths both got Deviants, both of which emphasize the most obnoxious aspects of the original monsters. At least Deviant Zinogre, Tigrex and Glavenus were pretty fun, even if they're still basically just stronger versions of the original versions with a few extra or modified attacks.

As for the actual new monsters, they're actually pretty decent overall. I think Glavenus is probably my favorite new fight; some of his attacks are pretty clever and his hitboxes are pretty spot on. Astalos (Raizex was a way better name) is like Seregios in that it's an aerial monster done right; they should really take away ""King of the Sky"" nonsense away from Rathalos and give it to one of them already. Mizutsune is a bit of a pushover but it's still a nice fight nonetheless. I don't hate it, but Gammoth (fuck this name, it's so bad) is definitely the worst of the flagships; the LR version is a snooze even by LR standards, but the HR version gains a stomp attack with a deceptively huge hitbox that could have been straight out of gen 1 Monster Hunter.

Also, it's pretty silly how they try to pass those four off as four flagships when Glavenus gets three times the attention as the other three, along with being the only one to get a Deviant version.

Great Maccao is a fun little romp of a fight and is the best ""introduction"" monster yet. Malfestio is alright when it's on its own but when you fight it alongside another monster it becomes cancer incarnate. Nakarkos is rad as fuck appearance wise but the fight itself is a bit too sandbaggy for me. Worse than Gogmazios or Dire Miralis, but way way way better than Dalamadur.

The Hyper monster system didn't really shake things up too much from the normal fights, especially when compared to MH4U's Frenzy. It's probably nice if you tend to use Arts alot, but I don't so whatever. At least it's not Apex.

The ability to upgrade pretty much any weapon to endgame status is a great idea but yet again, certain weapon lines are obviously better than others. Hell, I'd say it gets even worse this time around. For example, in MH4U IMO the Bounding Dalamadur was the best all-purpose IG and the Black Fatalis Blade was the best GS period, but they still had alternatives in the forms of Hellruin Glaive and the Cera Cymmetry. In MHGen, the best all-purpose weapon for almost every single weapon type is Hellblade Glavenus. Hope you enjoy farming Hellblade Powders, sucker.

It's the same for armor as well. The nerfing of formerly prevalent skills like Sharpness and the addition of new skills like Blunt Edge were supposed to increase variety in mixed sets, but in practice certain mixed sets like that Hayabusa + Silver Rath + Valk set that focuses on the newly buffed crit skills are still better than pretty much any other set in almost every situation. At least that mixed set actually looks pretty coherent, aesthetics wise.

Small things like ""hold A to gather"" are nice but really don't affect much outside of the starting hours of the game where you don't have access to the trading carts or in gathering quests. Speaking of which, there's an unholy amount of shit like gathering quests or ""kill X small monsters"" quests in this game. I really have no idea whose asinine idea it was to have so many of these filler quests in this game, especially when the only fun gameplay in Monster Hunter is in hunting big monsters. At least they removed that pointless ""advanced"" quest system from hub quests.

One aspect that's a pure step back is the game's performance. The framerate got worse from MH4U even on a N3DS. I really wish they'd move on from the 3DS already."	FALSE

&gt;A piece of shit? A cheater? A selfish bastard? That's what Jon Jones is. 

To you sure, but he's shown promise and shown atonement and if someone does change who they are to better themselves then its unfair to keep belittling them. He's got a rough road to go but he will be better because of it as a human being and he will come back a much greater more relatable person.

&gt;Forget him as a fighter, because it has inspired you with too much naivete

Incorrect, that would be a major disservice to his stellar fighting career, Jones has some growing to do I agree but his talents are legendary and when he comes back he will be a much better fighter because of this experience. Counting him out now is simply an emotional response but the reality is he wi return.

&gt;I'd prefer to be like one of the innumerable *good* examples of what I could aspire to be

Thats valid, you can look for aspiration in ant fighter and there are many great fighters in the sport so more power to you, however this doesnt disqualify Jones as a good example for the fans who still like him.

&gt;I feel sorry for you if you are inspired by Jon Jones, because it means you have no aspirations toward having a character worth any value.

Incorrect, this is your subjective short sighted opinion. You and i clearly see Jones differently, sure, but its extremely egotistical to assume that your view of him means anyone who does aspire to be like him as a fighter are all going to make the same mistakes as him, the fans of his are learning from his mistakes, not out to repeat them. We aspire to be like the talented fighter and good person that Jones is not the mistakes he made and the wrong he's done. Try not to get those mixed up, just because you refuse to see the good in Jones doesn't mean everyone also doesn't see the good in him.

&gt;Instead you've over-romanticized someone who time and again shows us truly how low of a person he is.

Everyone makes mistakes, its the change that the person makes to be better that defines them and Jones has shown he doesn't want to continue down the destructive path that he was on which shows he is a good person. Your emotionally charged opinion is based too much in the past.

&gt;I hope Jones never comes back to fighting

Then prepare to be disappointed. Jones coming back is a fact, the UFC wont end his career here especially when he makes good money for them. Jones will be back regardless of what we hope for.

&gt;I hope that you find someone worthy of all of this fanlove you have built up.

I have plenty of fighters i see as great fighters, Jones is one of them too. Its not up to you to decide who's worthy of a fan following and i suggest you refrain from acting like the judge of which fighter is worth looking up to.

&gt;Jon Jones is not one of them. 

You can't be the judge of that, a fighters skill has nothing to do with their character and people can like Jones for his fighting, its not up to you to count him out simply because he made mistakes."	FALSE

A lot of the missions in Star Citizen will be hand made, but many others will be procedurally generated by the economy system. 

Just like in space, its not hard to imagine doing bountyhunting or pirate missions on planets, with a focus on FPS and ground vehicles. Also, one would expect there to be good (if sparse) exploration things to find, along with scavenging ships like the one shown. 

As I mentioned, mining is a given. But there are also some comments made that may imply we may even be able to place prefabbed bases on planets for our friends to use as a home base. That is probably a post launch feature, though.

So I think at this point you are just being willfully ignorant since you brought up the same point again.
You clearly aren't willing to admit reality happened so I give up.


&gt; So all your points are either a complete misrepresentation of my own

Look, you aren't willing to admit US Christians went to Africa and tried to get an execute-the-gays bill passed in Uganda despite the fact it was documented by dozens of sources. Google it.

You are in literal denial of reality.

You can't just claim X is false when the rest of the world, even right-wing news sources, agrees X is true.

&gt; And when you tolerate a belief system that says people like you should be killed, that's nice and all that you're tolerant but these people actually want to kill you and will try to kill you!

You do realize the Bible literally says gays should be stoned right? And Christians openly try to get shit passed in various countries, including a ""Shoot the gays"" petition in the US?

I added links from right wing sources but automod killed it.

You're like one of those people who thinks ""ethics in games journalism"" should be a major debate topic.

Nobody is committing political violence based on fear or defense of a cartoon frog. There is bigger shit at stake here.

I'm plenty terrified of Trump because he's a moronic and wildly ignorant sack of shit who has zero cause or morals outside of feeding his own gargantuan ego, and a thin-skinned weak authoritarian bully who doesn't believe in democracy unless it's convenient for him. His bigotry can place second behind that. He's done a perfectly good job of freaking me out all by himself. Nobody in the Clinton campaign needed to tell me he was an existential danger to American democracy. I figured that shit out well over a year ago.

No, you have tremendous hate in your heart! No, you're the Russian puppet! No, you're the one who can't control their temperament!

This is true, but there are a lot of factors that made this impossible.  The PYD/PKK has a long-standing relationship with the Assad regime and had little interest in overthrowing it. Much of their initial territory in the north was taken with next to no fighting, as the YPG filled the void left by the government's withdrawal. It's likely that there was some arrangement here, though I wouldn't call it an alliance.  

&gt;However when al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham are seen as better allies than the YPG/J in the eyes of many FSA people, it demonstrates the extent to which democracy is (not) on the FSA's agenda.

YPG's separatism was just as squarely at odds with the FSA's nationalist agenda as the Islamists' ideology was at odds with the initial goals of the revolution. Throw in the fact that the Islamists helped the FSA fight Assad while the YPG did not, and the FSA's choice could only be expected.

(1) They very well may have accounted for the presence of these volcanoes, but it would still be a very rough estimate. If 95% of the ocean is undiscovered they aren't going to be capable of making an estimate anywhere near the acceptable amount to be able to sufficiently calculate it into statistics. They would be making an estimate of a large scale area of the earth based on one 5%. Could you imagine if scientists made an estimation on what 95% of the land areas of Earth were like simply based purely on what they knew of the UK (5% in this hypothetical example). 
(2) My point explains clearly why I believe there would be a spike in the past hundred years in CO2. I was suggesting the possibility that regardless of the amount of Co2 that is producecd and where it has come from, the large scale deforestation that mankind has caused to the earth is causing an excess of CO2 that would previously have been absorbed. I was not for any second suggesting that these volcanoes have started erupting at faster rates whatsoever. In fact I think its very likely they are fluctuating at the exact same rate as they always would be.
(3) You say that there is loads and loads of discussion on climate change being false but there isn't really to the extent you're suggesting. Any person who brings up the idea of it not being fact essentially gets ignored or disregarded in the scientific community. Yes the guys on morning tv might do it but they have nothing to lose. The Scientific Community appears full of constant ignoring of anyone saying otherwise. Im from the UK, our currently most famous scientist is a guy called Brian Cox and he every once in a while puts out statements criticising results and aspects of the climate change debate. ""Research presented as overly precise climate predictions rather than best advice is manipulated by nonsensical sceptics"" and every time he does, despite being beloved in this country he essentially gets heckled. Perhaps it's different where you're from but where I'm from the weather forecast is linked to climate change when there is anything that isn't bleak rain and the scientists who claim otherwise risk not being taken seriously.
(4) This is me least favourite of your parts. Where is the opponent to the earth revolving round the sun? Hundreds of years ago the whole planet thought the earth was flat and was the centre of the universe. The Earth revolving around the sun was the opposing view, as evidence continued to present itself and hypotheses were proven our views changed. When gravity was first discussed there were loads of people criticising the idea! Scientific theories are constantly being criticised and altered as new facts become present. Just today I read another story about scientists being able to show us what dinosaurs looked like. I think I've read the same story once a year my whole life. It changes all the time. Science is never finished, we're always progressing in what we know and that happens because people question everything! We discussed gravity etc for years and years, we also can say gravity exists for absolute fact. We can say climate change exists for absolute fact. We cannot however say why gravity exists or where it came from or how to control it for absolute fact nor can we with Climate Change. It's not all quite as straight forward as that.
(5) As I've said I don't really believe in conspiracy theory ideas, I just generally dislike them they're all a bit too far fetched. I don't think all climate change scientists are in it for the money in fact I don't think most of them would be at all. The companies that can get money from it can also help fund climate change debate though. If you get funded to do a certain thing you're going to do it. It's not about the scientists blatantly ignoring the facts and wanting to push the ideal its more that the idea will present itself if they're encouraged to find it. It's not necesarily purely a scientific deception. Brian Cox also stated that the "" level of accuracy had been manipulated by “nonsensical”, politically-motivated climate sceptics"". Again this is one of our most renowned scientists. Im not the only person who thinks the results being given are all a bit too specific. 
(6) To say Climate Change isn't the most profitable isn't really all that sound. There are a variety of moral and pracitcal reasons people would choose very specifically not to work in the Oil industry. To suggest the oil industry is vastly more profitable isn't correct either though. Firstly the US has just made a $3 billion dollar commitment to climate change funding. The money going into climate change is only actually increasing. Whereas the Oil industry whilst flourishing now is very clearly a non-renewable resource. It's going to peak and then it's going to go. You can join the oil industry for the ride and get that dosh but when the ride stops you're not going to ever get back into the climate change industry with that on your record haha.
(7) Well again the university in England that blatantly skewed its results on climate change would be an example. Renowned British Scientish Proffesor Brian Cox claiming that the results are a ""disservice to the public"" and stating that “You’re allowed to say, well I think we should do nothing. That’s a policy choice. But what you’re not allowed to do is to claim there’s a better estimate of the way that the climate will change, other than the one that comes out of the computer models. It’s nonsensical to say ‘we know better’, you can’t know better.” There the only examples I can give currently but so far thats a renowned scientist saying its all a bit enforced and encouraged, and an example of a funded scientific source blatantly pushing the ideal.

As I've said to others on here. I am more than happy to be proven wrong. I came on this thread for fun and to hear the arguments and I appreciate your time and effort, so cheers man.

**Apollo Brown - Clouds | Skilled Trade | Thirty Eight:** I've gotten in the habit of listening to instrumental hip hop on the weekends to sort clear my head after a busy week. I find it really relaxing, but much more engaging than pure ambient music. Listened through all of Apollo Brown's albums again. It's definitely exhausting if you try to listen to them all in one day. I think ""Clouds"" and ""Thirty Eight"" are better than ""Skilled Trade,"" but I'm not sure which I like better of the two. They're all really good, but include tracks I'm not as crazy about. Great soulful boom bap beats.

**u-Zik - Tango n Vectif:** this is a really long IDM double album that I haven't listened to in months, if not years. First time checking out the expanded re-release double album version. It's great, but it's definitely exhausting to listen to the whole thing at once. Very mechanical/industrial sounding rather than organic/ambient; although there's some of the latter.

**Tupac - Me Against the World:** one of my top 5 hip hop albums. I think it's easily his best. I love listening to this when I'm down or really stressed cuz it's such an emotional roller coaster. More than maybe any other rapper I've listened to, Tupac has such a commanding voice that demands to be heard. He really bears his soul on this album. Shit's mad real. What I also like this album is that it's very thematically complex. Although Tupac laments his lot as a young black man in inner city America, he also embraces the thug life that he's been forced into. It really shows his own ambivalence about life at the time and is reflective of the larger tension in rap between glorifying the life of crime and revealing the lower class African American condition. There are definitely some songs on this album that I don't like as much, but none of them are bad. I think they all contribute to the overall theme or are otherwise good. My favorite track, and favorite Tupac track overall, is *Lord Willing*. I feel like that track really encapsulates his musical project. Shit's a masterpiece.

**Brother Ali - Champion EP:** first time listening to this. Not as good as his debut, but still really good. Definitely wanna listen to more of his stuff. Favorite track is definitely *Love on Display*.

**Roc Marciano - Marberg LP:** binged on all of Roc Marciano's albums on spotify this past week, including ""Greneberg,"" but not ""UN or U"" out with the UN. I like all of his stuff, but I think his first two studio albums are definitely his best. I love how few features are on his first two albums; which is really different from his later stuff. Not sure which one out of his first two I like better, but I think it might be his first. *Pop* is my favorite song, but there's plenty of great ones. Can't wait for his and Ka's new projects. 

**Future Sound of London - Lifeforms:** this is another really long IDM double album, but not nearly as long as ""Tango n Vectif."" After listening to them back to back, I definitely prefer this over ""Tango n Vectif."" It's aptly named because it sounds like you're on an alien planet discovering alien life for the first time. It's really trippy.

No. It's actually one of the biggest parts of the problem if you factor in the rape of the stolen native land to sell resources to the US, china and the rest of the world.

Absolutely not. Obviously you'll want to steer clear of material that is sexually explicit, but secular novels, magazines and the like are simply types of entertainment reading which may or may not contribute more to understanding your faith. Staying informed about trends in popular culture, philosophy, and the like might help couch biblical situations in more modern contexts to aid understanding.  But biblical commentaries, while capable of being enormously useful, are to be taken as guides.  I happen to read from authors who come from a variety of traditions in this genre, including the Reformers, Puritans, Evangelicals, Methodists, and Catholics.

So long as enough of your brain cells are forming a continuous neural network, your consciousness remains in-tact. That active neural network with a constant feed of sensory input *is* your consciousness, and your self awareness.

What I'm curious to know is what would happen if you slowly started replacing chunks of your brain with artificial neural networks, simulating all the same inputs and outputs to the rest of your brain (assuming that's even possible). As it is gradual, and the neural network as a whole stays in-tact the entire time, it actually makes me think that it \*is\* possible to transfer our consciousness to a computer, or perhaps cloned brain tissue, or something suitable for simulating the complexity of the brain.

15354	"In my limited knowledge:  
  
It has to do with what nuclear configurations are stable for the element, and how that configuration can be created. If the more stable, easier-created isotopes are more massive, then the average atomic mass goes up, if they are lighter, it goes down. Sometimes, these ratios work out to give the situation you describe.  
  
In terms of stability:   
  
There are certain nuclear configurations that are more stable than others. For example, helium-4 (2 protons, 2 neutrons, 4 nucleons total) or oxygen-16 (8 of each, 16 total) are vastly more stable than a simple, naive model would predict.  
Generally speaking, it is about the relative energy levels of the nucleus configuration, with it tending towards lower energy states.  
  
As far as I know, there are many factors, some of whose effects are not very well known, as well as likely some factors which are currently only fuzzily known.  
  
A major one that's relatively mature is spin pairing. Each nucleon has a spin (up or down) and a pair is more stable than two singlets. Thus, isotopes with even number of nucleons are generally more stable.  
  
Nuclear decay processes is one which the theory is relatively well-known (some parts are still uncertain) but the predictive power is at times poor. If an isotope is high-energy (relatively speaking) but has no low-energy-barrier decay path, it will be more stable, and if one is low-energy but has a low-energy-barrier decay path, it will be less stable.  
  
One theory that is tossed around but has no particularly concrete form is that the nucleons in the nucleus have possible states similar to the orbitals of electrons, which would result in a pattern of higher-energy and lower-energy states. As far as I know, we don't have a good idea as to what this might look like.

Its not much harder than buying crap off of ebay. It is incredibly easy to find drugs online nowadays, if you cant find a physical dealer

&gt; Depends on whether people get drugs from clinics which will supply safe drugs in a controlled manner to wean people off of them. Regulation/legalization also doesn't necessarily stop all bad batches, people may still sell bad drugs at lower prices than legal sources - and more people may assume they're safe due to regulations, people do pass drugs around without knowing the original source.

With more regulations on the legal market, dealers have a higher standards to compete with. Marijuana quality has gotten a hell of a lot better in the US even where it is illegal due to places like Colorado legalizing it.

&gt; Other drugs - including heroin - have pain reducing and/or pleasure inducing effects which people do take to cope with things. You also simply don't know that people wouldn't do legal heroin.

But it is still a preference that has a big influence on attraction for them at the current time

This is being called bigotted or discriminatory without qualification. Which may or may not be accurate depending on the individual case.

Maybe many of them would be entirely support the same rights for everyone and people just going about their business, which doesn't seem discriminatory to me, because no one has a right to a relationship.

I guess I only think of it as discriminatory if someone is being excluded and the other person shouldn't have any say about excluding them. But when we're talking about relationships both people have a say and it can be refused for any reason.

You and I agree on the ""right to say no"" part, but I think people are balking at the ""right to say no but it makes them racist/sexist/transphobic/homophobic or any other type of bigotry.""

And I'd say 95% of the time, when BLM is invoked, its a black male, 15-25, caught in the process of committing a violent or property crime (I have never seen any of them picked up for dealing, and while pot is illegal in public, they are also never picked up for that).  They just shout it in addition to the ""racist"" ""police brutality"" and so on. And it attracts other public housing people, who also shout it and yell at the cops. 

Its fucked up. They took this movement, that they needed most, as the primary victim, and turned it into a way to try to get out of shoplifting charges and in support of the gangs tearing the community apart.

I think it’s notable that (f)Arya *didn’t* die. She may have if the Waif had gone for a clean kill, but instead she tried to make (f)Arya suffer and gave her time to escape. This shows that not only did the Waif disobey a direct order, not only did she also let her personal passions cloud her judgment, but she *failed* to kill her mark as a result of these. 

&gt; And if Jaquen is trading his life for Arya's why do we get the market scene? To me it just doesn't add up. There's obviously something funky going on with the whole situation but I think it's something else.

Great question. I’m not really sure. It’s a big question mark here. That’s the scene that most seems to convey that (f)Arya may in fact be Arya. However as I’ll explain, I think there are other possibilities.

So here’s the big question: what “talents” was it that led them to trying so hard to recruit her? My theory is that it’s her ability to warg, and her obsession with death, that lead them to believe she would be a powerful instrument of the MFG.

To start, we have a FM who can take on new identities at will sitting in the King’s Dungeon, who just so happens to head out in the same caravan as Arya. Who just so happens to be there and help her at her time of greatest need, when she is in Harrenhal trapped and losing her identity. She is playing the role of a peasant girl to survive, but has been so scared and beaten into submission that she forgets who she truly is, metaphorically seeing herself as a “mouse” rather than a “wolf.”

However from this same sequence in the books we see Jaqen giving her three lives in return for the ones she “saved,” the process of which gives her the power to take her identity back. She continues to play the role of the “mouse,” but inside she is a “wolf” with the power to take these lives through Jaqen. And then ultimately she manipulates him to set herself and her friends free.

Notably during this time she also commands Jaqen to kill Weese, and how does Weese die? He is mysteriously mauled to death *by his own dog*, which is entirely out of character for the animal. 

We also see from the Varamyr chapter that a warg who spends too long inside  another creature risks losing his or her own sense of identity and being consumed by the form the warg inhabits. The TER tells this to Bran in the show too, that spending too much time in the past could lead you to being lost. We see from his chapter too that the wight of Thistle seems to “know” him, as did the wight who tried to kill Lord Commander Mormont seem to retain some knowledge of his former life. When Arya dons the ugly girl’s face she is immediately overcome with the girl’s memories of being assaulted, memories which they took away when they gave her the “gift.” All of this leads me to believe that memories are connected to flesh, but that consciousness is somehow separate and apart from that. The FM “ride” these memories and flesh when they assume a new role, but it is critical that they retain memory of who they are lest they get lost in the role and forget their purpose.

All of this, I think, is crucial in what the FM are trying to teach her. They’re not trying to truly crush her identity...they’re teaching her to CONTROL what identity she chooses. Jaqen/the Kindly Man have an uncanny ability to tell when she’s lying...so surely they know she has hidden Needle away safely. And as Needle is so meticulously established as representative of her identity as Arya of House Stark, that I think is critical here: she is once again suppressing her own identity in order to take on the role of a FM...but not giving it up entirely. 

When Arya kills Daeron she tells the Kindly Man that she did it as “Arya of House Stark.” He doesn’t seem bothered by this. He does seem bothered that she “lies” when asked who she is now, and she responds “no one.” He doesn’t care that she killed a man without having orders, or that she killed a man as Arya of House Stark. He cares that she isn’t able to properly discern when she is “Arya” and when she is someone else, or when she is “no one.”  
&gt; The obvious answer is that they are testing to see if she is truly no-one. What better way to test that than to bring up her traumatic past and see if she is still capable of going through with the work they need doing.

So this is exactly it. The question is...what is the test? How is failure defined? How is success?

I don’t think failure is so simple as whether or not she kills the mark. As I explained, this seems to be a scenario where killing the actress seems like the clear and obvious choice. She’s told to kill the mark. Jaqen threatened her if she doesn’t kill the mark. The mark is playing someone on her list. Both the “no one” character she’s playing with the FM, and Arya of House Stark, have reasons to kill this girl. But she’s not “no one” and she’s not  “Arya of House Stark”...she’s “Mercy.” And “Mercy” was given a reason *not* to kill the actress.

The FM are not just hired assassins...they’re followers of the MFG, and as such there is a more philosophical underpinning to the work they do. Arya seems to want to serve the MFG by offering up the persons on her list. She has gifts to do so through her “warging” / consciousness shifting. And as the Kindly Man says in the books:

&gt; The one you call waif is a woman grown who has spent her life serving Him of Many Faces. She gave Him all she was, all she ever might have been, all the lives that were within her.

The MFG didn’t want the Waif to give her identity up...he wanted her to give them to *Him* in service. That’s what they want from Arya too...they want her to become a tool of the MFG. Arya of House Stark can remain, but the consciousness beneath is being enticed into service of the MFG whatever skin it is wearing.

15667	"To really get into what Trump is on a good level (and trust me, even as a Trump supporter, I have issues with him), I need to point out some things: There is a lot of problems with the USA's media, like a LOT of problems. Right now things are extremely polarized, and people are really misinformed on the issues on both accounts. The reason for this is that we have a new wave of authoritarian leftists who are trying to take over the state using whatever means necessary in order to do so. Try not to trust major news outlets quotes, often times Trump's quotes are taken out of context, and you really should look at the entire statement on any given issue rather than one quote.

So to first address whether Trump is racist or not: 

Trump is against illegals coming into the country, and wants to make it so that they have to go through the legal process. America has a ridiculously relaxed border, law enforcement often times lets illegals run around willy nilly without any documentation, and no one seems willing to really engage with it. Illegal are a problem because they are taken advantage of. Companies big and small use them as an under paid labor force to not only under sell them, but to under cut American workers (When I say American, I mean anyone who is a citizen of the United States). This is something that does need to happen because this is good for no one. It breeds hatred of Latinos for takin' der jerbs, Latinos don't get paid a fair wage, and the companies have to constantly abuse the system in order to hide the fact they they use illegals.

This point is touted off as racist because left leaners like to say that illegals is synonymous with Latinos, they are not. Right wingers are only against illegals and actually celebrate when forigners become American (This is because we have a different attitude, in say Germany, you cannot be considered German unless you are of German decent for the most part, here it just takes some papers and you are a brother in the fold.)

EDIT: He's also going to deport illegals, not all Mexicans, he's never said that he will deport all Mexicans, that's the kind of misinformation I'm talking about.

The second thing that people claim is racist is the forbidding Muslims from entering the country as a temporary ban. Personally, I don't agree with this either, but it's not racist. With the attacks on Brussels and France, we need to make sure people are safe. Now like I said, I don't agree with this whatsoever, but I think there is a legitimate claim to be made here.

Now I want to move on to how he talks the way he does. People have been posting ideas as to why he talks to plainly, and it's because of PC culture. I don't know what it's like where you're from, but there is such a PC scare that it's gotten everyone in a frenzy. It's refreshing to see someone who isn't afraid to talk about difficult subject matter, and considering that we're phasing out a president that was announcing the Wage Gap (which is an American issue where women as a whole [as in all women total] earn 77 cents to every dollar all men [as a whole] earn) is real and is a problem. The issue with this is that there is plenty of research and papers debunking the wage gap, and it's a case of the lie was told so often that people thought it was true. There is an actual wage gap, but how it comes about is through the women's actions, how many hours they work compared to a man, and what jobs they go into. Once you factor in those things, it disappears. Not to mention we already have a law, the equal pay act, which prohibits pay discrimination by gender or race.

So is Trump a serious guy and not an ass clown. We he's certainly a clown at times. Much of what he is, is a business man. He's stated many times throughout the race that you don't start negotiating with what you want, you start from the extreme and work your way to a middle ground. And we can see that he is willing to change his position on things if given reason to do so, which isn't a bad thing. Politicians need to appeal to the majority of people, it's their job, and it's silly to assume that any president should only represent his party's views. The president needs to take into account both sides, and he's trying to find a middle ground in this mess that left for him. He is a smart guy, he's just not that well informed because he's not a politician, which is fine because we can change him to do what we need him to do. He won't do silly things in spite of the people, he's even stated things like ""I'm willing to consider the min wage increase. Things are going to go so well that companies will be able to afford it.""

As a side note I want to mention his plan for the economy. Trump plans on changing the market so that companies have to build factories here in the states, and so that more businesses can thrive here in order to create more jobs. This is a brilliant plan, but only if it works. He's been very vague on how as far as I'm aware and I'm curious to see what he has in mind if he has anything at all. Though, to be honest, I'll admit he's not the greatest president, he's certainly better than the other options. "	FALSE

So Jewish banks exploded because they could use interest and became extremely successful, eventually the popes edict was abolished but st that point Jewish banks where the most popular and successful and they used money they earned if of interest loans and accounts to fund the arts. Hence why Jewish people are also associated with media.

Going through the process of prosecuting rape is stressful and involves a lot of questioning — successfully getting someone wrongly prosecuted is a serious accomplishment, assuming the jury does its job right.

http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/17/14243034/how-donald-trump-could-replace-obamacare-states

Basically, it goes like this... There are rules in the ACA already that encourage states to experiment with different ways to do coverage. Kentucky has the popular Kinect system, while other states have pondered the idea of single payer (Vermont, Hawaii, Colorado, California, Montana). If a state thinks they have a better/cheaper alternative to Obamacare, they can submit a plan for review by a bipartisan panel.

So basically Trump could say ""We're ripping out Obamacare and replacing it with something better! What is that, you ask? Well, we think its best for us to let the states experiment with their own ways of providing care that makes sense for them!""

Its kind of like repeal-and-delay, in that they can declare victory (calling Obamacare dead) and promote states rights... but if they cut the Obamacare taxes then funding any of these programs would be impossible. So even tho that's an easy out for them that has a high likelihood of yielding better programs, I dont see them going for it unless they have to. "	FALSE

Not sure what you mean here... How is energizing people to participate in politics a bad thing? How is people openly talking about how much they like someone a bad thing?

Also, having people who strongly favor you to offset those who strongly don't is a good thing. According to Huffpost Pollster, Hillary is 41.5% favorable, 54.7% unfavorable right now. Bernie is 50.3% favorable, 40.4% unfavorable.

You point to ""actual voting,"" but at least here in California, the AP announcement that Clinton already won the day before the election happened severely affected the voter turnout. One of the newspapers even ran it as a headline. In other states, there's been voter list purging, poll location closings, new rules for voting not being publicized ahead of time.

The voting has been anything but actual, and she has not acknowledged a single advantage she received from it all.

&gt; She certainly has been attacked quite a bit, but we seem to disagree on how much of it is actually pertinent.

The thing is that it doesn't matter whether the attacks are pertinent... there are a lot of them. The attack ads write themselves. On the other hand, Bernie is clean.

Even on little things, Bernie is so pure and nice. For example, I remember reading an article about some small town had to bill Hillary several times for the security they provided for her rally because she wasn't paying them. Bernie paid that same town ahead of time when he held a rally there. He's just a good guy overall."	FALSE

15844	"Well, if you're living roughly 80 miles north of Hadrian's Wall, you might in fact be a Roman citizen. Roman control over the region north of Hadrian's Wall was frequent for most of the Roman era in Britain; Agricola and others expanded the frontier to the Scottish lowlands in the late 1st Century AD, and when Hadrian's Wall was built, it was well within what you might consider the ""Roman border"". The later emperor Antoninus Pius built an additional wall further up the peninsula in the 160s/170s, of which only the foundation survives, and Septimius Severus (d. 211) was in Britain at the end of his reign, planning to push even further north.

This is, of course, complicated by exactly what a ""border"" meant in the premodern world; you might imagine it as a hazy ""zone of control"" where individual communities knew which tribe they belonged to and whether it was ultimately under Roman control. The geographical limits of that control might not be clear, and might have been more closely linked to tribal ranges or roaming patterns rather than fixed lines on a map. It's certainly possible to imagine people in rural regions or at the fringes of the Roman world not ""realizing"" that they were Roman or not. This is because the interaction of the average citizen with Roman cultural elements or social control were heavily interlaced with urbanism and social status: if you lived in a city, or were wealthy, you had access to more ""Roman"" cultural matter, such as social institutions (forums, public baths, magistrates, public entertainment, formal law). Peasants may have simply paid their taxes to their local chief or magistrate, worked their farms, and never seen anyone in Roman dress or heard the Latin tongue.

Now I know your initial question was probably asked with the perspective of the local peoples, the Picts or Scots, in mind. Their history is much more difficult to reconstruct because they were both preliterate and only infrequently mentioned by Roman written sources of the period (our best source for Britain at all is Tacitus' [Agricola](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/tacitus-agricola.asp), which is from around 100 AD and only somewhat reliable for ethnographic information). Once again, a defining factor would be social position. A chieftain of the Picti would definitely know who the Romans were and interact with their local officials on the subject of trade relations, border crimes, or mercenary hires. Many of them were at least moderately peaceful client states (de iure or de facto) of the Romans. An average person among the Picti who didn't travel much might only know the Romans as the people who live ""over there"" in a vague sense - much as, as a Californian, I have a vague sense of the geography and people of Arizona. But, unless there was a war on, he or she would be unlikely to have ever met one (except perhaps a trader) in the flesh."	FALSE

I have 3 Jolteons currently, two at ~1250CP and 1 at 929CP. The only one with Thunder is the 929CP, which would be a pain to power up even if it had great IVs, which it doesn't (66%). I actually wouldn't even have evolved it if I'd checked it's %, I just hoped it would be like 75%. So I'm not sure what to do. I will probably bin it along with one of the ones at 1250 eventually, but I'm so low on good grass/electric movesets right now that I won't bother. A 900CP Pokemon is not that helpful in a gym battle, but I did and do send it up against water Pokemon of all types. Even just getting one 'Thunder' in is acceptable. 

So yeah, I love Jolteon. I long for the day when I have a stronger group of them. I seem to be cursed with electric type Pokemon that have mediocre IVs and sub-par Movesets.

15978	"&gt; In other words color has something to do with frequency, but isn't interchangeable, and the differences are interesting and not perfectly understood.

No, what I'm saying is that those differences, while interesting, are *very* well understood. Perceived color has *everything* to do with the spectrum of light that you're seeing. How much light of which frequencies determines the color that you will see. We understand this well enough that we can figure out what color a person would see based solely on a supplied spectrum. Alternatively, you could provide a specific hue that you want to replicate and we know enough to provide *multiple* ways of reproducing it with additive colors (like on a computer screen) or subtractive colors (like print) based on the sensitivities of the three different kinds of cones in your eyes and the way the brain interprets those signals.

&gt;Incidentally, I suspect that intensity of light also affects perceived color -- objects look bluer in dim light, for instance, even though the photon frequencies shouldn't have changed. (For non-physicists, intensity/brightness of light has to do with number of photons as opposed to frequency of each photon.) But I don't have evidence besides my anecdotal perceptions, can anyone back this up? This isn't just me, is it?

This is the [Purkinje effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect) and occurs because of the relative sensitivities of the different cones and the rods in our eyes.

Once again, how we perceive color and its relationship to light is very well understood.

Media will always be biased. Even networks known for being objective are still subjective. It's impossible not to be biased because humans are biased.

That being said the reason popular media sucks is they are pandering. They found what the populace wants and that is what they are giving them. 

Sensationalism sells. People don't want facts they want emotion and ""Big"" stories. Media is a business and businesses cater to their companies. There is no way to change this.

Media should never be regulated because it is part of free speech. It is the last check and balance in the government. If you start regulating media you shut down a way for the populace to keep the government in check.

There are good news sources out there though that are doing what the press should do. It's up to you, me, and everyone else to decide what is true and what is sensationalist garbage.

if you create an object called ""Note"" which has the members ""measure, beat, xpos, ypos, xvel, yvel"", then you've basically just cut the code I linked here in half, and in his code by even more, because he reuses it for 3 and 4 as well. Then you could have ""Note notes[1000]"" and have 1000 of whatever this object is in less code than it took him to make 4.You can then also make a method for that class which adjusts the position based on the velocity, or something, and is generalizable. (for each Note in notes, add velocity to position, etc.)The way he's done it, he needs to update those objects by name every time any of them are supposed to be updated.

Relative motion, instrument scan techniques, picking up drift, etc, etc.... All of those are the basics of flight wherever you are. A lot of the nuanced differences in space flight and atmospheric flight can be simulated on the ground. Half the battle of flight itself is the 4 hours of planning for the 1 hour of flight. Most of those 4 hours are spent in the sim flying your mission profile endlessly until all the primary CoAs and contingencies are second nature.

16188	"Number 2 is a terrible idea (for confusing and counter-intuitive reasons). 

Term limiting a Senator means they have less experience then they could have.  They have less contacts with other politicians, and less relationships with which to build better coalitions to make compromise in passing bills.  

Additionally, with less experienced senators, who have a harder time figuring out what the hell they're supposed to do during roll call, or which position in which agency can assist with a particular issue, it makes **LOBBYISTS** more powerful, because they sure as hell *aren't* term limited.  Thus, these new senators become attached to lobbyists who know all the ropes and have been there before, can tell them how to get things done, and become the major power brokers.  You know, those same *evil* lobbyists that everyone hates because #CitizensUnited #EvilCorporations #etc.etc.

[Also, as an aside and only part of my main point, weak Senators means a stronger bureaucracy - you know, those same faceless non-elected cogs in the government machine that don't give a shit about you or anyone because they have government protections and let Veterans die via the VA and the IRS, and EPA doesn't give a shit about your land rights, or water rights, or BATFE coming up with stupid rules that can't be enforced, or the CIA or FBI or DEA saying **""fuck you to your civil liberties and privacy""**.  Yea, bureaucracy is bad too.]

Term limits protect politicians from becoming more beholden to lobbyists and corporations and advocacy groups(counter intuitive, isn't it?). We've seen what short term limits can do to state legislatures across the country.

Now, if you are a truly a ""of the people, by the people, for the people"" type person, you know that lobbyists are just ""people"" in the grand scheme of things.  When it comes to power, you must try to balance between ""the people,"" legislators, the judicial branch, the executive branch, and *now* the agency branch.  Corporations fall under the ""people"" branch, because they are not part of the system.  Just like the ACLU, labor unions, and Sierra Club aren't part of the system either.

So... do you want a powerful Senator? Or powerful lobbyists? Oh... I know --- you want powerful *people*!  So how do you get powerful *people* and how do the *people* become powerful? They join together to fight for their pet causes to form... lobbying groups!

Pick your poison, but limiting Senators to term limits has broader consequences than you might want to admit and the *people* won't get the power, because that's what lobbyists are for.... lobbyists both for and against **all the things you want or support!**

While it sounds very nice of them, in the deal you described you and your wife will end up paying 100% of the costs and will own 0% of the house. This will ultimately lead to family strife. In addition it's probably a bad financial deal for you, depending on the local market, since you're essentially getting a renter's deal but are paying ownership costs (including property tax, homeowners' insurance, and any PMI, which all get rolled into the mortgage payment.)

I'd suggest a different idea. If they want to take advantage of low rates and their good credit, they should buy the house themselves and rent it to you for an agreed-upon market-based rental price (or maybe they'll give you a good deal since you're family!) Sign a normal lease and everything. Now if you and your wife decide to leave, there are no hard feelings, your future in-laws still own the rental property and everyone's happy.

Keep in mind there can still be problems renting from family, but the nice thing is if it becomes a source of tension it's pretty easy to call off the arrangement.

16209	"&gt; Is it widely accepted, though?

I believe it is fair to say this, yes. I haven't seen any major study - in my field, anyway - that disputes Keegan's basic point. The fact that many people repeat it is the definition of ""widely accepted"". This acceptance may of course be due to lack of evidence, not because of its merits, but I think the theory is plausible enough, *if* it is properly circumscribed. I do not believe (and I did not claim) that cavalry cannot break any infantry. The point I made is that good order is a strong deterrent, but it is a fragile state for an infantry formation, and is easily lost. The crucial detail (which I stressed in my post) is that *any* gap, however small, can give horses the impression that there's a way through, provoking a physical collision. Keegan himself offers the example of a battle in which a horse that got shot during the charge fell upon the infantry line, flattening the front ranks and thus cracking open the formation, leading to its disintegration by the rest of the horsemen. The example you're citing from Livy involves a Roman formation already brought out of close order by ""the enemy's fiercest attacks"", so it's not hard to imagine how a horse might find a way in.

Meanwhile I find it hard to believe that real horses would, as movie scenes suggest, willingly impale themselves on pikes. This is what I meant when I said a solid line (i.e. unbroken shieldwall or pike phalanx) would be impenetrable to cavalry unless it wavered. The infantry line encountered by Churchill clearly wasn't a formation of this kind.

And of course it was *possible* for infantry to fight back against mounted opponents caught in melee, but should that fundamentally alter the scenario I sketched or are you just nitpicking for the sake of it? "	FALSE

A couple highlights:

&gt; The Kremlin’s 2010 purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One had to be approved by the nine members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

&gt; That included Clinton as secretary of state, but also the secretaries of the Treasury (the chairman of the committee), Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security as well as the the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The deal also had to be okayed by the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as Utah’s nuclear regulator.

&gt; While it’s conceivable Clinton advocated for the deal, the author of Clinton Cash Peter Schweizer himself admitted that he doesn’t have ""direct evidence"" proving Clinton played a part. 

I would say that it is implausible to think that the State Department's opinion on this would be significant compared to Defense, Commerce, Homeland Security and the various energy/nuclear regulatory agencies.

16499	Do you know *why* the decibel scale is logarithmic? Physically, the intensity of the wave is 1,000,000 times lesser, and nobody will argue with that. However human hearing is not linear, it is logarithmic, hence the scaling. This is why, on some badly designed sound systems, the volume slider has little effect near the top. The slider was built to scale linearly with wave intensity rather than with decibel level.	FALSE

16523	"**Let's shit on Valve for a second**  
Valve isn't without it's shortcomings.  Steam was a piece of shit when it launched.  It was a bloated, slow, unresponsive application that served no purpose other than being one of the earliest forms of always-on DRM (under the guise of ""VAC security"", which was near-nonexistent at launch, and remained a joke for a long time after).  

Most Valve games required it, including CS and Half-life.  The even retroactively added DRM to old titles that didn't need it.  This was back in a time when Internet access wasn't nearly as plentiful or available as it is now.  This was a *major* problem, as many features to alleviate these issues (like Steam's offline mode) didn't exist back then. 

There's a reason that [this](http://i.imgur.com/VdiqwH1.gif) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/NVyRZcx.jpg) exist.

**Why people like consoles**  
I don't think PC are hard to use, I've been on them since I wanted to buy that 486 DX2 66Mhz (she was a beast, baby).  But, that's not everyone.  Many people want to play a game without worrying about getting DX installed and running, or figuring out why it blackscreens, or updating graphics drivers, or any other issue that can and does arise with PC games.  

To make matters worse, they have to do this *at the exact time they just want to sit down and relax*. These problems are non-existent with console games. 

This is just one of the many reason why people buy console, and prefer them for playing games.  Do I agree with them?  Not really, I prefer Steam myself, but I understand why many don't.

**Game Deals**  
People who choose consoles over (or in addition to) PC's don't get the saving that others do.  

Both Xbox Live and PSN offer deals on games that can more than cover the cost of the subscription alone.  In addition to this, there's also the rotating free content.  For some, the sub isn't about the online content, it's about the game deals.

**Online Servers**  
Good quality reliable servers for games is also something a lot of players really want.  Valve has long let their servers sit at sub-par.  There's a reason people pay to play for ESEA Premium subscriptions (despite them being a horrible company), which costs more than double a PSN/Xbox Live sub.  Most major titles get very good servers for multiplayer provided/hosted by Sony/Microsoft now-days, and it's significantly better than even a few years ago.

But on the other hand, this is a double edged sword. We don't like it when Comcast has pulled the ""I have money so I'm going to lobby the shit out of Washington"" and I'm not 100% comfortable with this. I guess the lesson learned is ""hey, two can play at this game!"""	FALSE

But on top of that, it's also concerning that he seems to have no idea about the mechanics of what he's threatening to do. Is he threatening to pack the court? Does he know what court-packing is? Does he think the president can fire judges? Does he have any idea of how the Supreme Court works?

According to Paul Ryan, it's Hillary's SCOTUS nominations that we should be scared of. Stuff like this just proves he couldn't be more wrong."	FALSE

16567	"My three unpaid internships were the more influential on my career than all of college. 

My first one in radio showed me that either there is barely a gradual climb for talent. The top 5% can be in demand and well paid, there's maybe another 15% under that that do okay and like 80% of the rest of the talent are poorly paid and easily fireable. That made me realize I didn't want to work in radio. During that time, I went to tons of free concerts, had lots of free food and met so many cool people.

My next one was in local government, I saw a huge part of crime and poverty I never would have had my eyes opened to. The led directly to my third internship at a campaign committee. They specifically mentioned that previous experience with a government entity caused them to look at my resume. I had actual job experience before most people did, while still in college. Again, when I was applying for jobs to leave that internship, the committee I worked with had had involvement with the entity that hired me.

16587	I don't think they were trying to say that things like rape/assault are acceptable, just that asian women are viewed a lot more positively by society than asian men. A lot of TV shows emphasize this: asian girls are often shown as popular pretty girls, but guys are almost entirely shown as socially awkward nerds.	FALSE

&gt; At each session of Congress the question of further naval appropriations comes up. The swivel-chair admirals of Washington (and there are always a lot of them) are very adroit lobbyists. And they are smart. They don't shout that ""We need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation."" Oh no. First of all, they let it be known that America is menaced by a great naval power. Almost any day, these admirals will tell you, the great fleet of this supposed enemy will strike suddenly and annihilate 125,000,000 people. Just like that. Then they begin to cry for a larger navy. For what? To fight the enemy? Oh my, no. Oh, no. For defense purposes only.

Six years later, Pearl Harbor."	FALSE

Allowing the govnerment to ban any speech, for any reason, is inhernetly weakening the first amendment.

It doesn't mean we should tolerate bigotry; we shouldn't.  But I just don't think we want the govnerment to have to decide what is and isn't hate speech and what should or shouldn't be allowed.    

If we do that, then it's just as likely that the Republicans declare ""mocking Christianity"" or whatever to be hate speech, ect."	FALSE

It seems to me that smaller returns or a slower growth rate  would still be attractive to people that want to grow their capital through investment. We will have larger markets than before which would counteract at least some of the disadvantages of investing domestically, opposed to fleeing to overseas markets for investment.

Also, most businesses in America are small and privately owned. That's just a function of population size and the relatively small number of monopolies, it won't change until the small number of large corporations reach 100% market penetration. Stimulating local economies by increasing disposable income could help most of these companies find more customers willing/able to patronize them. 

These owners and employees purchase luxury goods or maybe just buy goods and services from slightly more expensive companies since they now have a salary increase both from UBI and the increased spending power of their customers. And so on, essentially trickling up through the economy, with the exception of any income spent at businesses that extract capital from the local economy like WalMart or Best Buy or Comcast.

I guess I'm thinking that investors being able to make  the most possible money isn't the best measure of the health and economic wellbeing of individual communities, and that's what most people seem to be focused on with the success of Bernie and Trump.

16702	"**PART TWO**

&gt; I'd simply have nobody to discuss it with unless I want to look like I'm totally off my rocker.

Yeah.  Me either.  I have my gf - who’s ultimately a pretty captive audience (lol), but A) she pretty much thinks I’m off my rocker anyway, and B) she’s not really very interested in the subject, so it’s not like I have an “active” person to talk about these issues and go back and forth on ideas with, which would be cool if I did.  I’ve had a pretty active interest in the subject of ETs as of the past few years now because I had experiences when I was young that were rather anomalous, and the more I looked into the issue, the more I started discovering a global coverup that links to a lot of other sociopolitical issues as well.

&gt; There should be programs available to help the parent(s) 100% with whatever it is they decide to do, whether they decide to keep their child, put it up for adoption, or abort it.

Cannot agree more with you here.

&gt; Some promiscuous woman who accidentally got knocked up? Those people just need help.

Absolutely.  I agree.  However, if those type of people really weren’t intending on having kids or don’t *want* kids but accidentally got pregnant anyway, then it just seems like a pretty horrible situation to bring a child into the world under those types of circumstances.  The child is *not wanted* under those circumstances, and to put an infant through a situation where they’re not wanted is just…argh.  It’s really horrendous as far as I’m concerned - nearly unconscionable.

&gt; if they truly *want* to have the kid and be happy, the community should support them all the way and help them be successful parents.

I mostly agree with that.  I mean if someone *wants* to have a kid, then there should indeed be programs available to help them.  Yes.  However, I also think that there are a lot of people who want to have kids…who maybe really *shouldn’t* have kids because they’re not ready or fit for it for some reason or the other regardless of whether they want to or not.

Like, for example, if it’s a young, unwed, teenage girl w/little education and she *really* wants a kid?  I still think she *shouldn’t* have a kid.

If she goes to school, gets married, has a good husband, they’re both adjusted and settled, and *then* she wants a kid?  Then hell yeah.  Have one if you want to under those circumstances.

I think it should ultimately be about what’s going to work *for the child*.  Seems to me too many people make the decision to have a kid based on what *they* want, when in fact what should really be given the top most consideration is whether or not it will be a good environment or good circumstance under which to bring a child into in the first place.

I feel that parenthood - and the consideration of going into it or not - is supposed to be a very unselfish undertaking:  It’s not about *you*.  It’s about *them* - the kid(s) - and I think too many people think too much about themselves first and what *they* want as opposed to the life of that unborn child and the kind of world that the child would be being brought into.

&gt; Those kids end up with shit lives under normal circumstances because nobody cares.

*Exactly this*, sir.  This is the *very* reason why, as much as I love children, I don’t think they should be brought into a world under anything less than optimal circumstances.  Heck, it’s *because* I love children that I feel this way.

&gt; The parents suck at being parents and nobody in the community is there to guide them or the kid. Maybe if they're lucky a friend or a relative or a teacher will help them out in some way, but for the vast majority of people, they face a cold world who's only word of guidance is, ""you're on your own"".

Agreed fully.

&gt; If everyone knew that no matter what, whether they wanted the kid or not, they'd have all the support they could possibly need, it wouldn't be such a stressful situation.

Not a bad point.

I realized that my saying “only the most worthy individuals should be fit to be parents” brings in the idea of a dictatorially controlled system where “only the state dictates who does and does not breed, citizen!  Eugenics for *everyone!”*

Yeah.  I certainly don’t mean that.  Heck, what you and I have been talking about this whole time has dealt with just how bad and untrustworthy the state is in the first place.  Last thing we want to do is give them the power to decide who does and does not breed.

However, at the same time, I don’t think that the rampant breeding that is the case now in today’s world is the answer either.  By far.

&gt; Don't bother with the movie though. It was pretty cheezy IMO and had almost nothing to do with the actual content of the book beyond the war with the bugs.

Yeah.  When you first mentioned the book, I was thinking “Is that the same as the *movie?”*  I saw the movie way back when, and it was *nothing* like what you just described here. lol  I just remember it as a cheesy, campy, not very good sci-fi flick.

&gt; I have a close friend with exact same circumstances. Adopted by a very loving family, has everything he could ever ask for, but still has major issues.

Introduce him to [this book right here.](https://www.amazon.com/Primal-Wound-Understanding-Adopted-Child/dp/0963648004)

*Do it*.

It has all but revolutionized my girlfriend’s perspective and has helped her (and us) a great deal.  We were already evolving and making progress, etc before she purchased the book, but her having purchased and read that book - and our sitting down and talking at length about it many times - has helped her a great deal in understanding why she is/was the way she is.

&gt; Been arrested multiple times, lots of drug and alcohol abuse, anger issues, etc. Usually comes off as a pretty normal guy, but you spend more time with him and you realize his door is off the hinges a little bit.

Yeah, man.  If you’re a real friend of his (and I don’t doubt that you are), GET HIM THAT FUCKING BOOK.  Seriously.  He might likely cry his ass off thinking that nobody understood what he’s been going through his whole life until he found that book.

&gt; I still hang out with him though, it's not really out of the ordinary for me to be friends with people who themselves are a little out of the ordinary. I tend to champion the underdogs since I know what it's like to be one myself.

You seem like an awesome fucking guy.

Cheers, bro.

Note that while I agree with you in this particular context, it makes sense to offer GEO circularization services in the following circumstances:

- If the comsat is all-electrical propulsion where it takes months to circularize. By using the second stage to circularize the orbit then the satellite can enter service much sooner. If the income generated by the transponders during those months is larger than the circularization service, or if the comsat is an urgent replacement for an older satellite that is failing, then it makes financial sense to buy the circularization option. An added bonus is more Xenon left for station keeping: circularization takes as much fuel as about 30 years of geostationary station keeping fuel costs ... Ion thruster size can probably be reduced as well.
- Unified launch architectures like the Falcon Heavy have such a huge Δv budget that circularization would not impose extra costs on SpaceX. As long as they sell the circularization option cheaper than it would be for the comsat operator to buy and integrate apogee kick motors, it makes financial sense for the customer to buy the circularization option and use the mass savings to add more transponders or more station keeping fuel.

So I don't think it's unconditionally true that circularization services make no financial sense. They make no financial sense *with current launch providers* - but I believe SpaceX is changing that equation with the Falcon Heavy.

If they leave the oligarchs will probably make good on their threats of hurting the UK's economy. They will try to make an example of them to scare others of not wanting to leave the EU. However I think the EU itself is doomed to economic collapse anyway the way things are going. Sweden is basically a preview of where the EU as a whole will be heading.

It is a smart foreign policy to empathize with the situation of political moderates in the country we're negotiating with and help them solidify their control of power so they can further liberalize and naturally not be our enemies in the future.

16777	"I work in subrogation, and we deal with collection agencies. If it was closed due to insufficient evidence, does the police report not put her at fault? If it does, they likely just closed due it to not being cost effective to file suit (you hit the nail on the head, blood from a stone issue). 

The shit thing about these claims is that uninsured drivers usually don't have insurance because they can't afford it, and likely don't have many physical assets to levy a debt against. Small claims suit is the next step, but its a tough choice to make. 

Assuming you have enough evidence to prove in the court that she is responsible, from what I'm aware it should be easy to obtain the judgment against her, but there aren't many resources to help you collect from her through that process. So you spend a few hundred bucks on small claims, get a judgment, then they say its on you to collect from her (not sure if you can get a judgment to have her reimburse for court costs as well). If she stonewalls you, I think I once heard about someone somehow getting the person's bank account information and having the court garnish or levy the account. Sounds like tough info to get though.

But there's the possibility of obtaining a judgment against her, and then depending on your states laws the judgment lasts for a certain amount of years. That way you can check up on her every so often during that time period and if you find out she came into some money you can maybe hire a collections professional on percentage to pursue her further.

Ultimately, maybe its cause I'm jaded but my philosophy now is this is why we get insurance. It fucking sucks it currently works like this, you end up paying for something that is not your fault. If you don't want to just let the aggravation go, it will likely be an uphill battle to get money from her without going crazy or spending more money than you'll get back.

A) In Nebraska a living wage for a single adult is ~ $9.50 (our minimum is $9/hr) for D.I.N.K.s it's ~ $8.50 so we effectively already have a living wage here.

B) When people suddenly come into money they spend it poorly in most cases. When people get gradual raises, they tend to spend it better than if they'd gone from (for example) $9/hr to $15/hr.

C) Look at Kansas, Puerto Rico, and Greece if you want to see what fiscal irresponsibility does on a large scale and at lottery winners if you want to see small scale examples.

D) If you have an actual argument against incremental increases that takes reality into account, I'd love to hear it. I support a $15/hr minimum, but recognize that doing it all at once would be a fucking disaster for the US economy, especially with the uncertainty in Europe over Brexit. You don't have to be an economist to see that doubling the minimum wage instantly will piss off businesses and potentially sink a ton of mom &amp; pop shops.

In the mid 1700s with the introduction of explosive shells they started using the short thick walls and polygonal shapes you see in lots of early US forts. Like fort Ticonderoga or fort McHenry.  

Then when rifles barrels and improved explosive shells were introduced the entire concept of building walls to protect was shelved.

16900	"&gt; Let's think of it from a social standpoint. Most men probably learn about sex from porn. Most pornography highlights the faster/harder the more she will like it. And what's foreplay? Blowjobs most likely.

I can't speak for all men, but this doesn't really sound plausible to me as a broad generalization.

First of all, even if you just look at the media, men wouldn't just learn from porn. In TV/movies, two really common themes are (1) women being upset how men don't do foreplay and (2) women being upset that men are quick and self-serving. So, regular TV/movies have pounded in the message that women need more foreplay and more of a focus on their pleasure.

Second, I'd like to think most men have the brain to realize that porn isn't real and that when they lose their virginity with a girl that it's a timid cooperative experience. I sure know that when I started I wasn't thinking of porn. I was in the moment paying attention to my girl's reactions to try to figure out what she liked and didn't...the same way I taught myself everything else.

A Sierpinski number is a number K so  that K2^(n)+1 is always composite for every number n. 1 is not a Sierpinski number because 1\*2^(0)+1=2 is prime. 2 is not a Sierpinski number because 2\*2^(0)=3 is prime. 3 is not a Sierpinski number because 3\*2^(1)+1=7 is prime. However, there do exist Sierpinski Numbers, we know that 78557  is one and there [are others](https://oeis.org/A076336) and, in fact, there are infinitely many of them. But an interesting question we can ask is ""What is the first Sierpinski Number?"" It is conjectured that 78557 is the first. 

We have used computers and checked almost all the candidates less than 78557, except for a few. Until recently, it was unknown whether or not the numbers 10223, 21181, 22699, 24737, 55459, and 67607 were Sierpinski numbers. But the new prime number found was 10223\*2^(31172165)+1 which shows that 10223 is *not* a Sierpinski number.

The search for (non)-Sierpinski Numbers is done on a large network of computers, rather than supercomputers, and is being run by the [Prime Grid](https://www.primegrid.com/) project. You can contribute by downloading the client and contributing to the ""Seventeen or Bust"" Project. "	FALSE

16989	I'm new to pokemon breeding, but trying to breed a Ralts with perfect IVs to be a Gallade (in Pokemon Y). I'm wondering about the usefulness of the Destiny Knot. I've heard that it's a useful breeding tool because a pokemon will inherit 5 IVs instead of 3, but after a lot of trial/error, it seems to be more of a hindrance than a help. When I had parents with no perfect IVs and one held a destiny knot, I filled 2 boxes with Ralts without any of them getting IVs of 31 in any stat. When i used parents who did not hold the destiny knot, I very quickly got an IV of 31 in attack. After a couple more generations of offspring I was reliably producing Ralts with 3 perfect IVs in HP, Attack, and Speed. I gave the Destiny Knot to the new set of parents, and suddenly all the offspring had 2 or fewer perfect IVs. Removed the Destiny Knot, and within a couple batches I get a Ralts with 4 perfect IVs. Gave it a destiny knot and paired it with another Ralts with 3 IVs (between them they have all the IVs I want), and the offspring have 2 IVs,  SOMETIMES 3. **In short, I tend to get better stats when I DON'T use the destiny knot.** Is it random luck? Am I misunderstanding how the Destiny Knot is supposed to work? Or is it just something you're only meant to use once your pokemon already have (close-to-)perfect IVs, to ensure their stats are passed down?	FALSE

Most free books seem to be low-quality genre fiction or public domain classics that haven't necessarily been scanned very well. I already own a lot of those as cheap paperbacks, so they don't really tempt me.

17075	"Yes we understand, but there are a few reasons that we make moderator comments in only a minority of cases. 

* Volume: in the last week, we removed ~1400 comments (~200/day), so it would simply be a *lot* of writing that we don't have time for (cuz we're busy removing comments, answering questions, etc). 
* Clutter: imagine this thread where each of the 9 [removed]s was followed by a moderator comment. 
* Meta: moderation comments often result in meta conversations (like this one!) which are off-topic from the OP's question, and so can and do derail the OP's thread. 

So, generally we go for a less-is-more approach, while still maintaining ""just enough"" moderation presence to answer quick meta questions, and keep all of the readers/respondents mindful of the sub rules."	FALSE

17093	"Many websites in Iran are permanently censored. These include most news outlets. Also most social networks including, facebook, youtube, linkedin and of course reddit are banned except for instagram I think. 

All chat apps except for telegram are also blocked. Telegram is open thanks to Rouhani :).

There are programs and proxies that people use to overcome the filtering but it's a constant battle. There are lots of ways but they keep getting blocked and you have to switch every month or so. Also it is even harder to get them working on mobile phones for example to connect to google play store.

Furthermore the government seems to limit data that is not decryptable. So the work arounds like tor, ssh and other dedicated anti-censoring softwares are very slow.

Also depending on the time and place the decryptable packets are completely stopped so there is no getting around. For example during election season or when there is a protest. Or in very small cities that are not familiar with the internet.

17097	How did he get the night stick? He fucking grabbed it during the struggle... how else would he get it? The department may have been aware of those things but the officer wasn't, nor should he have been expected to. He was responding to a call like any other call, that's it. As for restraining him or using a taser, he was being beaten in the head with a blunt object, which is deadly force, hence his use of deadly force.

I definitely don't want to go back to the times where gear and skills don't matter for healers. Having a good healer should be noticeable, instead of healers just being a checkmark so you can enter the dungeon
